19822889,2009 Oct,Dengue virus pathogenesis: an integrated view.,"Much remains to be learned about the pathogenesis of the different manifestations of dengue virus (DENV) infections in humans. They may range from subclinical infection to dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and eventually dengue shock syndrome (DSS). As both cell tropism and tissue tropism of DENV are considered major determinants in the pathogenesis of dengue, there is a critical need for adequate tropism assays, animal models, and human autopsy data. More than 50 years of research on dengue has resulted in a host of literature, which strongly suggests that the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS involves viral virulence factors and detrimental host responses, collectively resulting in abnormal hemostasis and increased vascular permeability. Differential targeting of specific vascular beds is likely to trigger the localized vascular hyperpermeability underlying DSS. A personalized approach to the study of pathogenesis will elucidate the basis of individual risk for development of DHF and DSS as well as identify the genetic and environmental bases for differences in risk for development of severe disease. b.martina@erasmusmc.nl","['Dengue/pathology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans']","['Much remains to be learned about the pathogenesis of the different manifestations of dengue virus (DENV) infections in humans.', 'They may range from subclinical infection to dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and eventually dengue shock syndrome (DSS).', 'As both cell tropism and tissue tropism of DENV are considered major determinants in the pathogenesis of dengue, there is a critical need for adequate tropism assays, animal models, and human autopsy data.', 'More than 50 years of research on dengue has resulted in a host of literature, which strongly suggests that the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS involves viral virulence factors and detrimental host responses, collectively resulting in abnormal hemostasis and increased vascular permeability.', 'Differential targeting of specific vascular beds is likely to trigger the localized vascular hyperpermeability underlying DSS.', 'A personalized approach to the study of pathogenesis will elucidate the basis of individual risk for development of DHF and DSS as well as identify the genetic and environmental bases for differences in risk for development of severe disease.', 'b.martina@erasmusmc.nl']"
30301880,2018 Oct 10,Dengue virus and the host innate immune response.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus that is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical countries where the transmission vectors Aedes spp. mosquitoes resides. There are four serotypes of the virus. Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning they elicit heterologous antibodies. Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype. Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease. This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state. Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease. It is important to understand out how the immune system reacts to infection and how the virus evades immune response in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines. tedross@uga.edu. tedross@uga.edu.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Dengue/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate']","['Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus that is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical countries where the transmission vectors Aedes spp. mosquitoes resides.', 'There are four serotypes of the virus.', 'Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning they elicit heterologous antibodies.', 'Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype.', 'Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease.', 'This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state.', 'Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease.', 'It is important to understand out how the immune system reacts to infection and how the virus evades immune response in order to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.', 'tedross@uga.edu.', 'tedross@uga.edu', '.']"
34696397,2021 Sep 30,Dengue Virus Infection: A Tale of Viral Exploitations and Host Responses.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease (arboviral) caused by the Dengue virus. It is one of the prominent public health problems in tropical and subtropical regions with no effective vaccines. Every year around 400 million people get infected by the Dengue virus, with a mortality rate of about 20% among the patients with severe dengue. The Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family, and it is an enveloped virus with positive-sense single-stranded RNA as the genetic material. Studies of the infection cycle of this virus revealed potential host targets important for the virus replication cycle. Here in this review article, we will be discussing different stages of the Dengue virus infection cycle inside mammalian host cells and how host proteins are exploited by the virus in the course of infection as well as how the host counteracts the virus by eliciting different antiviral responses.

27213782,2016,Meta-Analysis of Dengue Severity during Infection by Different Dengue Virus Serotypes in Primary and Secondary Infections.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue virus (DENV) infection is currently a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world; it has become more common and virulent over the past half-century and has gained much attention. Thus, this review compared the percentage of severe cases of both primary and secondary infections with different serotypes of dengue virus. METHODS: Data related to the number of cases involving dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS) or severe dengue infections caused by different serotypes of dengue virus were obtained by using the SCOPUS, the PUBMED and the OVID search engines with the keywords ""(dengue* OR dengue virus*) AND (severe dengue* OR severity of illness index* OR severity* OR DF* OR DHF* OR DSS*) AND (serotypes* OR serogroup*)"", according to the MESH terms suggested by PUBMED and OVID. RESULTS: Approximately 31 studies encompassing 15,741 cases reporting on the dengue serotypes together with their severity were obtained, and meta-analysis was carried out to analyze the data. This study found that DENV-3 from the Southeast Asia (SEA) region displayed the greatest percentage of severe cases in primary infection (95% confidence interval (CI), 31.22-53.67, 9 studies, n = 598, I2 = 71.53%), whereas DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 from the SEA region, as well as DENV-2 and DENV-3 from non-SEA regions, exhibited the greatest percentage of severe cases in secondary infection (95% CI, 11.64-80.89, 4-14 studies, n = 668-3,149, I2 = 14.77-96.20%). Moreover, DENV-2 and DENV-4 from the SEA region had been found to be more highly associated with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (95% CI, 10.47-40.24, 5-8 studies, n = 642-2,530, I2 = 76.93-97.70%), while DENV-3 and DENV-4 from the SEA region were found to be more highly associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (95% CI, 31.86-54.58, 9 studies, n = 674-2,278, I2 = 55.74-88.47%), according to the 1997 WHO dengue classification. Finally, DENV-2 and DENV-4 from the SEA region were discovered to be more highly associated with secondary infection compared to other serotypes (95% CI, 72.01-96.32, 9-12 studies, n = 671-2,863, I2 = 25.01-96.75%). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the presence of certain serotypes, including primary infection with DENV-3 from the SEA region and secondary infection with DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 also from the SEA region, as well as DENV-2 and DENV-3 from non SEA regions, increased the risk of severe dengue infections. Thus, these serotypes are worthy of special consideration when making clinical predictions upon the severity of the infection.

38649998,2024 Apr 22,Dengue virus pathogenesis and host molecular machineries.,"Dengue viruses (DENV) are positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. DENV is the causative agent of dengue, the most rapidly spreading viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Each year, millions of people contract the virus through bites from infected female mosquitoes of the Aedes species. In the majority of individuals, the infection is asymptomatic, and the immune system successfully manages to control virus replication within a few days. Symptomatic individuals may present with a mild fever (Dengue fever or DF) that may or may not progress to a more critical disease termed Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or the fatal Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In the absence of a universally accepted prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic drug, treatment is mostly restricted to supportive measures. Similar to many other viruses that induce acute illness, DENV has developed several ways to modulate host metabolism to create an environment conducive to genome replication and the dissemination of viral progeny. To search for new therapeutic options, understanding the underlying host-virus regulatory system involved in various biological processes of the viral life cycle is essential. This review aims to summarize the complex interaction between DENV and the host cellular machinery, comprising regulatory mechanisms at various molecular levels such as epigenetic modulation of the host genome, transcription of host genes, translation of viral and host mRNAs, post-transcriptional regulation of the host transcriptome, post-translational regulation of viral proteins, and pathways involved in protein degradation.

27853992,2017 Feb,Progress towards understanding the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. There are 4 serotypes of DENV that cause human disease through transmission by mosquito vectors. DENV infection results in a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from mild fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the latter of which can progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death. Researchers have made unremitting efforts over the last half-century to understand DHF pathogenesis. DHF is probably caused by multiple factors, such as virus-specific antibodies, viral antigens and host immune responses.

In addition, the maturation process of dengue virus is inefficient and therefore some partially immature dengue virus particles have been observed and they are infectious. All these viral particles have different antigenicity profiles and thus may affect the type of the elicited antibodies during an immune response. Understanding the molecular determinants and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature) in inducing morphological changes in the virus and how potent antibodies interact with these particles is important for designing effective therapeutics or vaccines. Several techniques, including cryoEM, site-directed mutagenesis, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, time-resolve fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and molecular dynamic simulation, have been performed to investigate the structural changes. This review describes all known morphological variants of DENV discovered thus far, their surface protein dynamics and the key residues or interactions that play important roles in the structural changes.

28335410,2017 Mar 13,Non-Canonical Roles of Dengue Virus Non-Structural Proteins.,"The Flaviviridae family comprises a number of human pathogens, which, although sharing structural and functional features, cause diseases with very different outcomes. This can be explained by the plurality of functions exerted by the few proteins coded by viral genomes, with some of these functions shared among members of a same family, but others being unique for each virus species. These non-canonical functions probably have evolved independently and may serve as the base to the development of specific therapies for each of those diseases. Here it is discussed what is currently known about the non-canonical roles of dengue virus (DENV) non-structural proteins (NSPs), which may account for some of the effects specifically observed in DENV infection, but not in other members of the Flaviviridae family. This review explores how DENV NSPs contributes to the physiopathology of dengue, evasion from host immunity, metabolic changes, and redistribution of cellular components during infection.

23389466,2013 Feb 6,Carbohydrate-related inhibitors of dengue virus entry.,"Dengue virus (DENV), which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causes fever and hemorrhagic disorders in humans. The virus entry process mediated through host receptor molecule(s) is crucial for virus propagation and the pathological progression of dengue disease. Therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus entry is essential for an understanding of dengue pathology and for the development of effective new anti-dengue agents. DENV binds to its receptor molecules mediated through a viral envelope (E) protein, followed by incorporation of the virus-receptor complex inside cells. The fusion between incorporated virus particles and host endosome membrane under acidic conditions is mediated through the function of DENV E protein. Carbohydrate molecules, such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and glycosphingolipids, and carbohydrate-recognition proteins, termed lectins, inhibit virus entry. This review focuses on carbohydrate-derived entry inhibitors, and also introduces functionally related compounds with similar inhibitory mechanisms against DENV entry.

Here, we use time-lapse imaging of virus replication in thousands of single cells, combined with computational inference, to identify rate-limiting steps for dengue virus (DENV), a widespread human pathogen. Comparing wild-type DENV with a vaccine candidate mutant, we show that the viral spread in the mutant is greatly attenuated by delayed onset of productive replication, whereas wild-type and mutant virus have identical replication rates. Single-cell analysis done after applying the broad-spectrum antiviral drug, ribavirin, at clinically relevant concentrations revealed the same mechanism of attenuating viral spread. We conclude that the initial steps of infection, rather than the rate of established replication, are quantitatively limiting DENV spread. Heidelberg, Germany. Heidelberg, Germany.

19802577,2010,Dengue virus virulence and transmission determinants.,"The mechanisms of dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis are little understood because we have no models of disease; only humans develop symptoms (dengue fever, DF, or dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) and research has been limited to studies involving patients. DENV is very diverse: there are four antigenic groups (serotypes) and three to five genetic groups (genotypes) within each serotype. Thus, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative virulence or transmissibility of each DENV genotype; both of these factors are important determinants of epidemiology and their measurement is complex because the natural cycle of this disease involves human-mosquito-human transmission. Although epidemiological and evolutionary studies have pointed to viral factors in determining disease outcome, only recently developed models could prove the importance of specific viral genotypes in causing severe epidemics and their potential to spread to other continents. These new models involve infection of primary human cell cultures, ""humanized"" mice and field-collected mosquitoes; also, new mathematical models can estimate the impact of viral replication, human immunity and mosquito transmission on epidemic behavior. DENV evolution does not seem to be rapid and the transmission and dispersal of stable, replication-fit genotypes has been more important in the causation of more severe epidemics.

33672226,2021 Feb 23,Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Intrahost Diversity in Patients with Different Clinical Outcomes.,"Intrahost genetic diversity is thought to facilitate arbovirus adaptation to changing environments and hosts, and it might also be linked to viral pathogenesis. Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) has circulated in Brazil since 1990 and is associated with severe disease and explosive outbreaks. Intending to shed light on the viral determinants for severe dengue pathogenesis, we sought to analyze the DENV-2 intrahost genetic diversity in 68 patient cases clinically classified as dengue fever (n = 31), dengue with warning signs (n = 19), and severe dengue (n = 18). Unlike previous DENV intrahost diversity studies whose approaches employed PCR, here we performed viral whole-genome deep sequencing from clinical samples with an amplicon-free approach, representing the real intrahost diversity scenario. Striking differences were detected in the viral population structure between the three clinical categories, which appear to be driven mainly by different infection times and selection pressures, rather than being linked with the clinical outcome itself. Diversity in the NS2B gene, however, showed to be constrained, irrespective of clinical outcome and infection time. Finally, 385 non-synonymous intrahost single-nucleotide variants located along the viral polyprotein, plus variants located in the untranslated regions, were consistently identified among the samples. Of them, 124 were exclusively or highly detected among cases with warning signs and among severe cases. However, there was no variant that by itself appeared to characterize the cases of greater severity, either due to its low intrahost frequency or the conservative effect on amino acid substitution. Although further studies are necessary to determine their real effect on viral proteins, this heightens the possibility of epistatic interactions. The present analysis represents an initial effort to correlate DENV-2 genetic diversity to its pathogenic potential and thus contribute to understanding the virus's dynamics within its human host.

25157370,2014,Progress in the identification of dengue virus entry/fusion inhibitors.,"Dengue fever, a reemerging disease, is putting nearly 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide. The number of infections and the geographic extension of dengue fever infection have increased in the past decade. The disease is caused by the dengue virus, a flavivirus that uses mosquitos Aedes sp. as vectors. The disease has several clinical manifestations, from the mild cold-like illness to the more serious hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Currently, there is no approved drug for the treatment of dengue disease or an effective vaccine to fight the virus. Therefore, the search for antivirals against dengue virus is an active field of research. As new possible receptors and biological pathways of the virus biology are discovered, new strategies are being undertaken to identify possible antiviral molecules. Several groups of researchers have targeted the initial step in the infection as a potential approach to interfere with the virus. The viral entry process is mediated by viral proteins and cellular receptor molecules that end up in the endocytosis of the virion, the fusion of both membranes, and the release of viral RNA in the cytoplasm. This review provides an overview of the targets and progress that has been made in the quest for dengue virus entry inhibitors. Research and Technology Services (INDICASAT-AIP), P.O.

37175867,2023 May 2,Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Facilitates Genome Compaction and Packaging.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded (+)-sense RNA virus that infects humans and mosquitoes, posing a significant health risk in tropical and subtropical regions. Mature virions are composed of an icosahedral shell of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins circumscribing a lipid bilayer, which in turn contains a complex of the approximately 11 kb genomic RNA with capsid (C) proteins. Whereas the structure of the envelope is clearly defined, the structure of the packaged genome in complex with C proteins remains elusive. Here, we investigated the interactions of C proteins with viral RNA, in solution and inside mature virions, via footprinting and cross-linking experiments. We demonstrated that C protein interaction with DENV genomes saturates at an RNA:C protein ratio below 1:250. Moreover, we also showed that the length of the RNA genome interaction sites varies, in a multimodal distribution, consistent with the C protein binding to each RNA site mostly in singlets or pairs (and, in some instances, higher numbers). We showed that interaction sites are preferentially sites with low base pairing, as previously measured by 2'-acetylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) reactivity indicating structuredness. We found a clear association pattern emerged: RNA-C protein binding sites are strongly associated with long-range RNA-RNA interaction sites, particularly inside virions. This, in turn, explains the need for C protein in viral genome packaging: the protein has a chief role in coordinating these key interactions, promoting proper packaging of viral RNA. Such sites are, thus, highly consequential for viral assembly, and, as such, may be targeted in future drug development strategies against these and related viruses.

28620207,2017 Jun 15,Dengue virus activates cGAS through the release of mitochondrial DNA.,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS) is a DNA-specific cytosolic sensor, which detects and initiates host defense responses against microbial DNA. It is thus curious that a recent study identified cGAS as playing important roles in inhibiting positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viral infection, especially since RNA is not known to activate cGAS. Using a dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) vaccine strain (PDK53), we show that infection creates an endogenous source of cytosolic DNA in infected cells through the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to drive the production of cGAMP by cGAS. Innate immune responses triggered by cGAMP contribute to limiting the spread of DENV to adjacent uninfected cells through contact dependent gap junctions. Our result thus supports the notion that RNA virus indirectly activates a DNA-specific innate immune signaling pathway and highlights the breadth of the cGAS-induced antiviral response. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. 169857, Singapore. cktang79@gmail.com. 169857, Singapore. engeong.ooi@duke-nus.edu.sg.

29293524,2018,Fitness peaks of dengue virus populations.,"The role of intra-host genetic diversity in dengue viral populations remains a topic of debate, particularly the impact on transmission of changes in this diversity. Several approaches have been taken to increasing and decreasing the genetic diversity of populations of RNA viruses and have drawn what appear to be contradictory conclusions.

24606701,2014 Mar,Viral kinetics of primary dengue virus infection in non-human primates: a systematic review and individual pooled analysis.,"Viremia kinetics directly influence the clinical course and transmission dynamics of DENV, but many aspects of viral dynamics remain unknown. Non-human primates (NHP) have been used as a model system for DENV infection for decades. Here, we identify papers with experimentally-infected NHP and estimate the time to- and duration of viremia as well as estimate associations between these and serotype, inoculating dose, viremia assay, and species of NHP. We estimate the time to viremia in rhesus macaques to range from 2.63 to 3.32 days for DENV-2 and -1 and the duration to range from 3.13 to 5.13 days for DENV-4 and -2. We find no differences between non-human primates for time to viremia or duration, and a significant negative relationship between inoculating dose and duration of viremia. These results aid in understanding the transmission dynamics of sylvatic DENV non-human primates, an issue of growing importance as dengue vaccines become available.","['Animals', 'Dengue/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Viremia/*virology']","['Viremia kinetics directly influence the clinical course and transmission dynamics of DENV, but many aspects of viral dynamics remain unknown.', 'Non-human primates (NHP) have been used as a model system for DENV infection for decades.', 'Here, we identify papers with experimentally-infected NHP and estimate the time to- and duration of viremia as well as estimate associations between these and serotype, inoculating dose, viremia assay, and species of NHP.', 'We estimate the time to viremia in rhesus macaques to range from 2.63 to 3.32 days for DENV-2 and -1 and the duration to range from 3.13 to 5.13 days for DENV-4 and -2.', 'We find no differences between non-human primates for time to viremia or duration, and a significant negative relationship between inoculating dose and duration of viremia.', 'These results aid in understanding the transmission dynamics of sylvatic DENV non-human primates, an issue of growing importance as dengue vaccines become available.']"
34695119,2021 Oct,Emergence of dengue virus serotype 2 in Mauritania and molecular characterization of its circulation in West Africa.,"The number of sporadic and epidemic dengue fever cases have reportedly been increasing in recent years in some West African countries, such as Senegal and Mali. The first epidemic of laboratory-confirmed dengue occurred in Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania situated in the Saharan desert, in 2014. On-site diagnosis of dengue fever was established using a rapid diagnostic test for dengue. In parallel, the presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the city was confirmed. The initial diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR, which showed that all samples from the 2014 dengue epidemic in Nouakchott were dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The whole genome or envelope protein gene of these strains, together with other DENV-2 strains obtained from travelers returning from West African countries to France between 2016 and 2019 (including two Mauritanian strains in 2017 and 2018), were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a recent emergence of an epidemic strain from the cosmopolitan genotype belonging to West African cosmopolitan lineage II, which is genetically distinct from African sylvatic genotype. The origin of this DENV-2 lineage is still unknown, but our data seem to suggest a recent and rapid dispersion of the epidemic strain throughout the region. More complete genome sequences of West African DENV-2 are required for a better understanding of the dynamics of its circulation.

28157234,2017 Feb 3,The citrus flavanone naringenin impairs dengue virus replication in human cells.,"Dengue is one of the most significant health problems in tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world. Nearly 390 million cases are reported each year. Although a vaccine was recently approved in certain countries, an anti-dengue virus drug is still needed. Fruits and vegetables may be sources of compounds with medicinal properties, such as flavonoids. This study demonstrates the anti-dengue virus activity of the citrus flavanone naringenin, a class of flavonoid. Naringenin prevented infection with four dengue virus serotypes in Huh7.5 cells. Additionally, experiments employing subgenomic RepDV-1 and RepDV-3 replicon systems confirmed the ability of naringenin to inhibit dengue virus replication. Antiviral activity was observed even when naringenin was used to treat Huh7.5 cells 24 h after dengue virus exposure. Finally, naringenin anti-dengue virus activity was demonstrated in primary human monocytes infected with dengue virus sertoype-4, supporting the potential use of naringenin to control dengue virus replication.

33794785,2021 Apr 1,Systemic dengue infection associated with a new dengue virus type 2 introduction in Brazil - a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue infection is caused by an arbovirus with a wide range of presentations, varying from asymptomatic disease to unspecific febrile illness and haemorrhagic syndrome with shock, which can evolve to death. In Brazil, the virus circulates since the 1980s with many introductions of new serotypes, genotypes, and lineages since then. Here we report a fatal case of dengue associated with a Dengue virus (DENV) lineage not detected in the country until now. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 58-year-old man arrived at the hospital complaining of fever and severe abdominal pain due to intense gallbladder edema, mimicking acute abdomen. After 48 h of hospital admission, he evolved to refractory shock and death. DENV RNA was detected in all tissues collected (heart, lung, brain, kidney, spleen, pancreas, liver, and testis). Viral sequencing has shown that the virus belongs to serotype 2, American/Asian genotype, in a new clade, which has never been identified in Brazil before. The virus was phylogenetically related to isolates from central America [Puerto Rico (2005-2007), Martinique (2005), and Guadeloupe (2006)], most likely arriving in Brazil from Puerto Rico. CONCLUSION: In summary, this was the first fatal documented case with systemic dengue infection associated with the new introduction of Dengue type 2 virus in Brazil during the 2019 outbreak.

28615658,2017 Jun 14,Serotyping dengue virus with isothermal amplification and a portable sequencer.,"The recent development of a nanopore-type portable DNA sequencer has changed the way we think about DNA sequencing. We can perform sequencing directly in the field, where we collect the samples. Here, we report the development of a novel method to detect and genotype tropical disease pathogens, using dengue fever as a model. By combining the sequencer with isothermal amplification that only requires a water bath, we were able to amplify and sequence target viral genomes with ease. Starting from a serum sample, the entire procedure could be finished in a single day. The analysis of blood samples collected from 141 Indonesian patients demonstrated that this method enables the clinical identification and serotyping of the dengue virus with high sensitivity and specificity. The overall successful detection rate was 79%, and a total of 58 SNVs were detected. Similar analyses were conducted on 80 Vietnamese and 12 Thai samples with similar performance. Based on the obtained sequence information, we demonstrated that this approach is able to produce indispensable information for etiologically analyzing annual or regional diversifications of the pathogens.

The emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in most tropical countries has made its control a public health priority, but no vaccines or treatments exist. Little is understood about dengue virus pathogenesis, because no other animals develop symptoms of disease, and research, therefore, has been limited to studies involving patients. Although epidemiologic and evolutionary studies have pointed to host and viral factors in determining disease outcome, only recently developed models could prove the importance of viral genotypes in causing severe epidemics. The influence of host immune status and mosquito vectorial capacity are also being tested in mathematical models to determine virus population dynamics. Therefore, new technologies are allowing us to better understand how specific virus variants cause more disease than others, and these virus variants should be targeted for detection, control, and treatment.

21075353,2010 Nov 18,Dengue virus-induced autophagy regulates lipid metabolism.,"Autophagy influences numerous cellular processes, including innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, some viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), usurp autophagy to enhance their replication. The mechanism for a positive role of autophagy in DENV infection is unclear. We present data that DENV induction of autophagy regulates cellular lipid metabolism. DENV infection leads to an autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to release free fatty acids. This results in an increase in cellular β-oxidation, which generates ATP. These processes are required for efficient DENV replication. Importantly, exogenous fatty acids can supplant the requirement of autophagy in DENV replication. These results define a role for autophagy in DENV infection and provide a mechanism by which viruses can alter cellular lipid metabolism to promote their replication.","['Animals', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dengue Virus/immunology/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocytes/*virology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/*virology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Virus Replication']","['Autophagy influences numerous cellular processes, including innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular pathogens.', 'However, some viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), usurp autophagy to enhance their replication.', 'The mechanism for a positive role of autophagy in DENV infection is unclear.', 'We present data that DENV induction of autophagy regulates cellular lipid metabolism.', 'DENV infection leads to an autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to release free fatty acids.', 'This results in an increase in cellular β-oxidation, which generates ATP.', 'These processes are required for efficient DENV replication.', 'Importantly, exogenous fatty acids can supplant the requirement of autophagy in DENV replication.', 'These results define a role for autophagy in DENV infection and provide a mechanism by which viruses can alter cellular lipid metabolism to promote their replication.']"
34372598,2021 Jul 17,Potential Phosphorylation of Viral Nonstructural Protein 1 in Dengue Virus Infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a spectrum of dengue diseases that have unclear underlying mechanisms. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein of DENV that is involved in DENV infection and dengue pathogenesis. This study investigated the potential post-translational modification of DENV NS1 by phosphorylation following DENV infection. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), 24 potential phosphorylation sites were identified in both cell-associated and extracellular NS1 proteins from three different cell lines infected with DENV. Cell-free kinase assays also demonstrated kinase activity in purified preparations of DENV NS1 proteins. Further studies were conducted to determine the roles of specific phosphorylation sites on NS1 proteins by site-directed mutagenesis with alanine substitution. The T27A and Y32A mutations had a deleterious effect on DENV infectivity. The T29A, T230A, and S233A mutations significantly decreased the production of infectious DENV but did not affect relative levels of intracellular DENV NS1 expression or NS1 secretion. Only the T230A mutation led to a significant reduction of detectable DENV NS1 dimers in virus-infected cells; however, none of the mutations interfered with DENV NS1 oligomeric formation. These findings highlight the importance of DENV NS1 phosphorylation that may pave the way for future target-specific antiviral drug design. Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.

31843340,2020 Jan-Feb,Differential replicative fitness of the four dengue virus serotypes circulating in Colombia in human liver Huh7 cells.,"Dengue has been a significant public health problem in Colombia since the simultaneous circulation of the four dengue virus serotypes. The replicative fitness of dengue is a biological feature important for virus evolution and contributes to elucidating the behavior of virus populations and viral pathogenesis. However, it has not yet been studied in Colombian isolates. This study aimed to compare the replicative fitness of the four dengue virus serotypes and understand the association between the serotypes, their in vitro infection ability, and their replication in target cells. We used three isolates of each DENV serotype to infect Huh-7 cells at an MOI of 0.5. The percentage of infected cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay, and the pathogenicity index was calculated as a ratio of both parameters. The replicative fitness was measured by the number of viral genome copies produced using quantitative PCR and the production of infectious viral progeny was measured by plaque assay. We showed that Huh-7 cells were susceptible to infection with all the different strain isolates. Nevertheless, the biological characteristics, such as infectious ability and cell viability, were strain-dependent. We also found different degrees of pathogenicity between strains of the four serotypes, representative of the heterogeneity displayed in the circulating population. When we analyzed the replicative fitness using the mean values obtained from RT-qPCR and plaque assay for the different strains, we found serotype-dependent behavior. The highest mean values of replicative fitness were obtained for DENV-1 (log 4.9 PFU/ml) and DENV-4 (log 5.28 PFU/ml), followed by DENV-2 (log 3.9 PFU/ml) and DENV-3 (log 4.31 PFU/ml). The internal heterogeneity of the replicative fitness within each serotype could explain the simultaneous circulation of the four DENV serotypes in Colombia. España, S.L.U.

26645957,2016 Apr,Dengue virus infection-enhancing antibody activities against Indonesian strains in inhabitants of central Thailand.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection-enhancing antibodies are a hypothetic factor to increase the dengue disease severity. In this study, we investigated the enhancing antibodies against Indonesian strains of DENV-1-4 in 50 healthy inhabitants of central Thailand (Bangkok and Uthai Thani). Indonesia and Thailand have seen the highest dengue incidence in Southeast Asia. The infection history of each subject was estimated by comparing his/her neutralizing antibody titers against prototype DENV-1-4 strains. To resolve the difficulty in obtaining foreign live viruses for use as assay antigens, we used a recombinant system to prepare single-round infectious dengue viral particles based on viral sequence information. Irrespective of the previously infecting serotype(s), most serum samples showed significantly higher enhancement titers against Indonesian DENV-2 strains than against Thai DENV-2 strains, whereas the opposite effect was observed for the DENV-3 strains. Equivalent enhancing activities were observed against both DENV-1 and DENV-4. These results suggest that the genotype has an impact on enhancing antibody activities against DENV-2 and DENV-3, because the predominant circulating genotypes of each serotype differ between Indonesia and Thailand. reserved.

26887252,2016 Jan-Mar,"Phylogenetic analysis of Dengue virus 1 isolated from South Minas Gerais, Brazil.","Dengue is a major worldwide public health problem, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Primary infection with a single Dengue virus serotype causes a mild, self-limiting febrile illness called dengue fever. However, a subset of patients who experience secondary infection with a different serotype can progress to a more severe form of the disease, called dengue hemorrhagic fever. The four Dengue virus serotypes (1-4) are antigenically and genetically distinct and each serotype is composed of multiple genotypes. In this study we isolated one Dengue virus 1 serotype, named BR/Alfenas/2012, from a patient with dengue hemorrhagic fever in Alfenas, South Minas Gerais, Brazil and molecular identification was performed based on the analysis of NS5 gene. Swiss mice were infected with this isolate to verify its potential to induce histopathological alterations characteristic of dengue. Liver histopathological analysis of infected animals showed the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, hepatic steatosis, as well as edema, hemorrhage and necrosis focal points. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses based on the envelope gene provided evidence that the isolate BR/Alfenas/2012 belongs to genotype V, lineage I and it is probably derived from isolates of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The isolate BR/Alfenas/2012 showed two unique amino acids substitutions (SER222THRE and PHE306SER) when compared to other Brazilian isolates from the same genotype/lineage. Molecular models were generated for the envelope protein indicating that the amino acid alteration PHE 306 SER could contribute to a different folding in this region located within the domain III. Further genetic and animal model studies using BR/Alfenas/2012 and other isolates belonging to the same lineage/genotype could help determine the relation of these genetic alterations and dengue hemorrhagic fever in a susceptible population.

30396090,2019 Jan,A proteomic analysis of the anti-dengue virus activity of andrographolide.,"Andrographolide is a major bioactive constituent of Andrographis paniculata that has been shown in vitro to have antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including the mosquito transmitted dengue virus (DENV). However, how andrographolide exerts an anti-DENV effect remains unclear. This study therefore sought to further understand the mechanism of action of andrographolide in inhibiting DENV infection of liver cells using a proteomic based approach. Both 1 dimension (D) and 2D proteome systems were used. Initial data was generated through andrographolide treatment of HepG2 cells without DENV infection (1D analysis), while subsequent data was generated through a combination of andrographolide treatment and DENV infection (2D analysis). A total of 17 (1D) and 18 (2D) proteins were identified as differentially regulated. The analyses identified proteins involved in chaperone activities, as well as energy production. In particular evidence suggested an important role for GRP78 and the unfolded protein response in mediating the anti-DENV activity of andrographolide, which might, in part, explain the broad antiviral activity of andrographolide.

Having knowledge on the current circulating dengue serotypes and population of vector mosquitoes is key in controlling outbreaks and future outbreak predictions. The current study reports the first study on detecting dengue virus serotypes in the Aedes mosquito population in Sibu and Miri divisions of Sarawak. Mosquito samples were collected at selected localities from September 2016 to December 2017. Localities were selected mainly focussing on urban residential areas. The mosquitoes collected comprises of the field-caught adults and immatures collected from artificial and natural water containers. Collected mosquitoes were identified to species level and screened for the presence of dengue virus using conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was identified in 3 pools of field-caught female Aedes albopictus adults collected from Jalan Tong Sang, Sibu, Sibu Lake Garden, and Taman Ceria, Permyjaya, Miri, respectively. DENV-2 was also detected in one pool of adult male Ae. albopictus emerged from immatures collected from Taman Ceria, Permyjaya, Miri. The findings in this study revealed that Ae. albopictus was the main species colonizing the study areas, and the current circulating dengue virus serotype was DENV-2. This study also reports the first natural evidence of transovarial transmission of dengue in the natural population of Ae. albopictus within the study area and provides information as reference for further vector-pathogen studies.

33667752,2021 May,On the role of surrounding regions in the fusion peptide in dengue virus infection.,"Dengue virus infection depends on its fusion with the host membrane, where the binding occurs through interaction between proteins on the virus cell surface and specific viral receptors on target membranes. This process is mediated by the fusion peptide located between residues 98 and 112 (DRGWGNGCGLFGKGG) that forms a loop in domain II of dengue E glycoprotein. In this study, we evaluated the role of fusion peptide surrounding regions (88-97 and 113-123) of the Dengue 2 subtype on its interaction with the membrane and fusion activity. These sequences are important to stabilize the fusion peptide loop and increase fusion activity. Three peptides, besides the fusion peptide, were synthesized by SPPS using the Fmoc chemical approach. The first contains the fusion peptide and the C-terminal region of the loop (sequence 98-123); another contains the N-terminal region (88-112) and the larger peptide contains both regions (88-123). The peptides were able to interact with a model membrane. Differences in morphology of the monolayer promoted by the peptides were assessed by Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM). Our data indicated that the C-terminal region of fusion peptide loop is more efficient in promoting fusion and interacting with the membrane than the N-terminal sequence, which is responsible for the electrostatic initial interaction. We propose a 2-step mechanism for the interaction of the dengue virus fusion peptide with the host membrane, where the N-terminal sequence docks electrostatically on the headgroups and then the C-terminal interacts via hydrophobic forces in the acyl chains.

31085207,2019 Aug,"Phylogenetically based establishment of a dengue virus panel, representing all available genotypes, as a tool in dengue drug discovery.","Dengue fever is the most widespread of the human arbovirus diseases, with approximately one third of the world's population at risk of infection. Dengue viruses are members of the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) and, antigenically, they separate as four closely related serotypes (1-4) that share 60-75% amino acid homology. This genetic diversity complicates the process of antiviral drug discovery. Thus, currently no approved dengue-specific therapeutic treatments are available. With the aim of providing an efficient tool for dengue virus drug discovery, a collection of nineteen dengue viruses, representing the genotypic diversity within the four serotypes, was developed. After phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genomes, we selected relevant strains from the EVAg collection at Aix-Marseille University and completed the virus collection, using a reverse genetic system based on the infectious sub-genomic amplicons technique. Finally, we evaluated this dengue virus collection against three published dengue inhibitory compounds. NITD008, which targets the highly conserved active site of the viral NS5 polymerase enzyme, exhibited similar antiviral potencies against each of the different dengue genotypes in the panel. Compounds targeting less conserved protein subdomains, such as the capsid inhibitor ST-148, or SDM25N, a ∂ opioid receptor antagonist which indirectly targets NS4B, exhibited larger differences in potency against the various genotypes of dengue viruses. These results illustrate the importance of a phylogenetically based dengue virus reference panel for dengue antiviral research. The collection developed in this study, which includes such representative dengue viruses, has been made available to the scientific community through the European Virus Archive to evaluate novel DENV antiviral candidates.

METHODOLOGY: This study employed a cross-sectional design. Ninety-six dengue-infected children admitted to Can Tho Children's Hospital between October 2022 and March 2023 were included. Confirmation of dengue infection was achieved through the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among the identified serotypes, DENV-2 accounted for the highest proportion (71.87%), followed by DENV-1 (23.96%), and DENV-4 (4.17%). DENV-3 was not detected. No significant demographic, disease severity, or laboratory differences were observed among the identified dengue serotypes. However, DENV-2 was associated with a higher occurrence of mucous membrane hemorrhages and gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Although DENV-2 was the most prevalent serotype responsible for dengue in children in southern Vietnam, it did not lead to more severe cases compared to other serotypes. This finding is crucial for evaluating the illness's prognosis. Mai, Tho Kieu Anh Pham, Toan Hoang Ngo, Huy Bui Thai Nguyen, Cuong Manh Nguyen; Hieu Van Duong; Phuong Minh Nguyen.

33639996,2021 Feb 27,"New genotype invasion of dengue virus serotype 1 drove massive outbreak in Guangzhou, China.","BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has caused major health problems. Variations in dengue virus (DENV) genes are important features of epidemic outbreaks. However, the associations of DENV genes with epidemic potential have not been extensively examined. Here, we assessed new genotype invasion of DENV-1 isolated from Guangzhou in China to evaluate associations with epidemic outbreaks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used DENV-1 strains isolated from sera of dengue cases from 2002 to 2016 in Guangzhou for complete genome sequencing. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed to elucidate the genotype characteristics and determine if new genotype invasion was correlated with major outbreaks. In our study, a new genotype invasion event was observed during each significant outbreak period in 2002-2003, 2006-2007, and 2013-2014. Genotype II was the main epidemic genotype in 2003 and before. Invasion of genotype I in 2006 caused an unusual outbreak with 765 cases (relative risk [RR] = 16.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.41-21.25). At the middle and late stages of the 2013 outbreak, genotype III was introduced to Guangzhou as a new genotype invasion responsible for 37,340 cases with RR 541.73 (95% CI 417.78-702.45), after which genotypes I and III began co-circulating. Base mutations occurred after new genotype invasion, and the gene sequence of NS3 protein had the lowest average similarity ratio (99.82%), followed by the gene sequence of E protein (99.86%), as compared to the 2013 strain. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Genotype replacement and co-circulation of multiple DENV-1 genotypes were observed. New genotype invasion was highly correlated with local unusual outbreaks. In addition to DENV-1 genotype I in the unprecedented outbreak in 2014, new genotype invasion by DENV-1 genotype III occurred in Guangzhou.

10233934,1999 Jun,Dengue virus structural differences that correlate with pathogenesis.,"The understanding of dengue virus pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of in vitro and in vivo models of disease. The study of viral factors involved in the production of severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), versus the more common dengue fever (DF), have been limited to indirect clinical and epidemiologic associations. In an effort to identify viral determinants of DHF, we have developed a method for comparing dengue type 2 genomes (reverse transcriptase PCR in six fragments) directly from patient plasma. Samples for comparison were selected from two previously described dengue type 2 genotypes which had been shown to be the cause of DF or DHF. When full genome sequences of 11 dengue viruses were analyzed, several structural differences were seen consistently between those associated with DF only and those with the potential to cause DHF: a total of six encoded amino acid charge differences were seen in the prM, E, NS4b, and NS5 genes, while sequence differences observed within the 5' nontranslated region (NTR) and 3' NTR were predicted to change RNA secondary structures. We hypothesize that the primary determinants of DHF reside in (i) amino acid 390 of the E protein, which purportedly alters virion binding to host cells; (ii) in the downstream loop (nucleotides 68 to 80) of the 5' NTR, which may be involved in translation initiation; and (iii) in the upstream 300 nucleotides of the 3' NTR, which may regulate viral replication via the formation of replicative intermediates. The significance of four amino acid differences in the nonstructural proteins NS4b and NS5, a presumed transport protein and the viral RNA polymerase, respectively, remains unknown. This new approach to the study of dengue virus genome differences should better reflect the true composition of viral RNA populations in the natural host and permit their association with pathogenesis.

32003339,2019 Jul-Sep,Emergence of dengue virus 4 as the predominant serotype during the outbreak of 2017 in South India.,"CONTEXT: Dengue virus (DENV) causes acute febrile illness in tropical and subtropical countries. In India there is a steady increase in incidence since 1950s which could be attributed to emergence of new serotype or lineage\clade shifts in circulating DENV. AIMS: We aimed to perform molecular characterisation and phylogenetic analysis on samples from the recent outbreak (August-October 2017). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiological analysis of dengue outbreak. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Samples positive for non-steroidal 1 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 147) were included. The study was approved by our institute ethics committee (JIP/IEC/2018/496). Five hundred and eleven base pair of capsid and pre-membrane encoding genes (CprM) region was amplified using Lanciotti primers, followed by second round of polymerase chain reaction using serotype specific primers. Samples which were positive by second round (n = 68) were sequenced and genotyped using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis and phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA7 software. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of CprM sequences identified all 4 serotypes in circulation during this outbreak. We observed both single (n = 50) and concurrent infections (n = 18), with DENV4 as the major contributor (64%). Within Genotype I of DENV4 we observed a distinct new clade (Clade E) which was 2.6% ± 0.9%-5.5% ± 1.1% divergent from the other clades. Among the concurrent infection, DENV 4 and DENV 2 combination was observed to form the majority (77.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall this study documents the emergence of DENV4 as the major serotype in circulation, replacing DENV1, 2 and 3 which had been previously reported from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. This substantiates the need for continuous monitoring in endemic countries like India, where such data may impact the formulation of vaccine policy for dengue. JIPMER, Puducherry, India.

33819302,2021,Probability of consolidation constrains novel serotype emergence in dengue fever virus.,"Since their first sequencing 40 years ago, Dengue virus (DENV) genotypes have shown extreme coherence regarding the serotype class they encode. Considering that DENV is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus with a high mutation rate, this behavior is intriguing. Here, we explore the effect of various parameters on likelihood of new serotype emergence. In order to determine the time scales of such an event, we used a Timed Markov Transmission Model to explore the influences of sylvatic versus peri-urban transmission, viral mutation rate, and vertical transmission on the probabilities of novel serotype emergence. We found that around 1 000 years are required for a new serotype to emerge, consistent with phylogenetic analysis of extant dengue serotypes. Furthermore, we show that likelihood of establishing chains of mosquito-human-mosquito infection, known as consolidation, is the primary factor which constrains novel serotype emergence. Our work illustrates the restrictions on and provides a mechanistic explanation for the low probability of novel dengue virus serotype emergence and the low number of observed DENV serotypes.

27155198,2017 Apr,Antiviral activity of Carbenoxolone disodium against dengue virus infection.,"As one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases, dengue infection is now becoming a global concern due to its rapid spread and rise in incidence. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus (DENV) infection. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses. However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV-permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time-of-addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells. Directly incubating DENV with CBX resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity. Furthermore, DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself. Our work, for the first time, demonstrates that CBX has antiviral activity against DENV infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue.

31392945,2019 Oct,Epidemiological and Evolutionary Analysis of Dengue-1 Virus Detected in Guangdong during 2014: Recycling of Old and Formation of New Lineages.,"The incidence of dengue is increasing in Guangdong, China, with the largest outbreak to date in 2014. Widespread awareness of epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the dengue virus (DENV) is required. In 2014, we isolated the virus from patients and sequenced its genome. The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005, DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014, an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I, which caused recent epidemics, demonstrated a continuation of new lineages, and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries. The lack of sufficient epidemiological data and evidence on the local mosquito-borne DENV emphasizes the importance of studying the molecular evolutionary features and establishing a well-established phylogenetic tree for dengue prevention and control in Guangdong.

29153860,2018 Jan 15,The antimicrobial peptide HS-1 inhibits dengue virus infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Studies reveal that peptides secreted by amphibians have many functions, such as antiviral and antimicrobial activities. As there is no antiviral drug effective against the DENV, the antiviral activity of a synthetic peptide called HS-1, derived from the secretion of the anuran Hypsiboas semilineatus, has been evaluated. The assays of neutralization in the Vero cells show a complete inhibition of infection of the serotypes 2 and 3.

30463971,2019 Feb 15,RNA Helicase A Is an Important Host Factor Involved in Dengue Virus Replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) utilizes host factors throughout its life cycle. In this study, we identified RNA helicase A (RHA), a member of the DEAD/H helicase family, as an important host factor of DENV. In response to DENV2 infection, nuclear RHA protein was partially redistributed into the cytoplasm. The short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RHA significantly reduced the amounts of infectious viral particles in various cells. The RHA knockdown reduced the multistep viral growth of DENV2 and Japanese encephalitis virus but not Zika virus. Further study showed that the absence of RHA resulted in a reduction of both viral RNA and protein levels, and the data obtained from the reporter replicon assay indicated that RHA does not directly promote viral protein synthesis. RHA bound to the DENV RNA and associated with three nonstructural proteins, including NS1, NS2B3, and NS4B. Further study showed that different domains of RHA mediated its interaction with these viral proteins. The expression of RHA or RHA-K417R mutant protein lacking ATPase/helicase activity in RHA-knockdown cells successfully restored DENV2 replication levels, suggesting that the helicase activity of RHA is dispensable for its proviral effect. Overall, our work reveals that RHA is an important factor of DENV and might serve as a target for antiviral agents.IMPORTANCE Dengue, caused by dengue virus, is a rapidly spreading disease, and currently there are no treatments available. Host factors involved in the viral replication of dengue virus are potential antiviral therapeutic targets. Although RHA has been shown to promote the multiplication of several viruses, such as HIV and adenovirus, its role in the flavivirus family, including dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and emerging Zika virus, remains elusive. The current study revealed that RHA relocalized into the cytoplasm upon DENV infection and associated with viral RNA and nonstructural proteins, implying that RHA was actively engaged in the viral life cycle. We further provide evidence that RHA promoted the viral yields of DENV2 independent of its helicase activity. These findings demonstrated that RHA is a new host factor required for DENV replication and might serve as a target for antiviral drugs. Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.

36682882,2023 Feb 14,Rapid Diagnostic Tests for the Detection of the Four Dengue Virus Serotypes in Clinically Relevant Matrices.,"The efficient and accurate diagnosis of dengue, a major mosquito-borne disease, is of primary importance for clinical care, surveillance, and outbreak control. The identification of specific dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) to DENV-4 can help in understanding the transmission dynamics and spread of dengue disease. The four rapid low-resource serotype-specific dengue tests use a simple sample preparation reagent followed by reverse transcription-isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) combined with lateral flow detection (LFD) technology. Results are obtained directly from clinical sample matrices in 35 min, requiring only a heating block and pipettes for liquid handling. In addition, we demonstrate that the rapid sample preparation step inactivates DENV, improving laboratory safety. Human plasma and serum were spiked with DENV, and DENV was detected with analytical sensitivities of 333 to 22,500 median tissue culture infectious doses (TCID(50))/mL. The analytical sensitivities in blood were 94,000 to 333,000 TCID(50)/mL. Analytical specificity testing confirmed that each test could detect multiple serotype-specific strains but did not respond to strains of other serotypes, closely related flaviviruses, or chikungunya virus. Clinical testing on 80 human serum samples demonstrated test specificities of between 94 and 100%, with a DENV-2 test sensitivity of 100%, detecting down to 0.004 PFU/μL, similar to the sensitivity of the PCR test; the other DENV tests detected down to 0.03 to 10.9 PFU/μL. Collectively, our data suggest that some of our rapid dengue serotyping tests provide a potential alternative to conventional labor-intensive RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) detection, which requires expensive thermal cycling instrumentation, technical expertise, and prolonged testing times. Our tests provide performance and speed without compromising specificity in human plasma and serum and could become promising tools for the detection of high DENV loads in resource-limited settings. IMPORTANCE The efficient and accurate diagnosis of dengue, a major mosquito-borne disease, is of primary importance for clinical care, surveillance, and outbreak control. This study describes the evaluation of four rapid low-resource serotype-specific dengue tests for the detection of specific DENV serotypes in clinical sample matrices. The tests use a simple sample preparation reagent followed by reverse transcription-isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) combined with lateral flow detection (LFD) technology. These tests have several advantages compared to RT-qPCR detection, such as a simple workflow, rapid sample processing and turnaround times (35 min from sample preparation to detection), minimal equipment needs, and improved laboratory safety through the inactivation of the virus during the sample preparation step. The low-resource formats of these rapid dengue serotyping tests have the potential to support effective dengue disease surveillance and enhance the diagnostic testing capacity in resource-limited countries with both endemic dengue and intense coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission.

24302878,2013,Dengue virus type 2: protein binding and active replication in human central nervous system cells.,"An increased number of dengue cases with neurological complications have been reported in recent years. The lack of reliable animal models for dengue has hindered studies on dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis and cellular tropism in vivo. We further investigate the tropism of DENV for the human central nervous system (CNS), characterizing DENV interactions with cell surface proteins in human CNS cells by virus overlay protein binding assays (VOPBA) and coimmunoprecipitations. In VOPBA, three membrane proteins (60, 70, and 130 kDa) from the gray matter bound the entire virus particle, whereas only a 70 kDa protein bound in white matter. The coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed three proteins from gray matter consistently binding virus particles, one clearly distinguishable protein (~32 kDa) and two less apparent proteins (100 and 130 kDa). Monoclonal anti-NS3 targeted the virus protein in primary cell cultures of human CNS treated with DENV-2, which also stained positive for NeuH, a neuron-specific marker. Thus, our results indicate (1) that DENV-2 exhibited a direct tropism for human neurons and (2) that human neurons sustain an active DENV replication as was demonstrated by the presence of the NS3 viral antigen in primary cultures of these cells treated with DENV-2.

26670386,2015 Dec 15,Suppression of Drug Resistance in Dengue Virus.,"Dengue virus is a major human pathogen responsible for 400 million infections yearly. As with other RNA viruses, daunting challenges to antiviral design exist due to the high error rates of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Indeed, treatment of dengue virus infection with a nucleoside analog resulted in the expected genetic selection of resistant viruses in tissue culture and in mice. However, when the function of the oligomeric core protein was inhibited, no detectable selection of drug resistance in tissue culture or in mice was detected, despite the presence of drug-resistant variants in the population. Suppressed selection of drug-resistant virus correlated with cooligomerization of the targeted drug-susceptible and drug-resistant core proteins. The concept of ""dominant drug targets,"" in which inhibition of oligomeric viral assemblages leads to the formation of drug-susceptible chimeras, can therefore be used to prevent the outgrowth of drug resistance during dengue virus infection. IMPORTANCE: Drug resistance is a major hurdle in the development of effective antivirals, especially those directed at RNA viruses. We have found that one can use the concept of the genetic dominance of defective subunits to ""turn cousins into enemies,"" i.e., to thwart the outgrowth of drug-resistant viral genomes as soon as they are generated.

26248692,2015 Oct,Anti-dengue virus serotype 2 activity and mode of action of a novel peptide.,"AIM: To identify a novel antiviral peptide against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) by screening a phage display peptide library and to evaluate its in vitro antiviral activity and mode of action. METHODS AND RESULTS: A phage display peptide library was biopanned against purified DENV-2 and resulted in the identification and selection of a peptide (peptide gg-ww) for further investigation. ELISA was performed, and peptide gg-ww was shown to possess the highest binding affinity against DENV-2. Thus, peptide gg-ww was synthesized for cytotoxicity and antiviral assays. Virus plaque reduction assay, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assay were used to investigate the inhibitory effect of peptide gg-ww on DENV-2 infection in Vero cells. Three different assays (pre-, simultaneous and post-treatments assays) were performed to investigate the peptide's mode of action. Results indicated that peptide gg-ww possessed strong antiviral activity with a ~96% inhibition rate, which was achieved at 250 μmol l(-1) . Viral replication was inhibited during a simultaneous treatment assay, indicating that the entry of the virus was impeded by this peptide. CONCLUSIONS: Peptide gg-ww displayed antiviral action against DENV-2 by targeting an early stage of viral replication (i.e. during viral entry).

25833044,2015 Jun,Determinants of Dengue Virus NS4A Protein Oligomerization.,"Flavivirus NS4A protein induces host membrane rearrangement and functions as a replication complex component. The molecular details of how flavivirus NS4A exerts these functions remain elusive. Here, we used dengue virus (DENV) as a model to characterize and demonstrate the biological relevance of flavivirus NS4A oligomerization. DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4A protein forms oligomers in infected cells or when expressed alone. Deletion mutagenesis mapped amino acids 50 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain [TMD1]) of NS4A as the major determinant for oligomerization, while the N-terminal 50 residues contribute only slightly to the oligomerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of NS4A amino acids 17 to 80 suggests that residues L31, L52, E53, G66, and G67 could participate in oligomerization. Ala substitution for 15 flavivirus conserved NS4A residues revealed that these amino acids are important for viral replication. Among the 15 mutated NS4A residues, 2 amino acids (E50A and G67A) are located within TMD1. Both E50A and G67A attenuated viral replication, decreased NS4A oligomerization, and reduced NS4A protein stability. In contrast, NS4A oligomerization was not affected by the replication-defective mutations (R12A, P49A, and K80A) located outside TMD1. trans complementation experiments showed that expression of wild-type NS4A alone was not sufficient to rescue the replication-lethal NS4A mutants. However, the presence of DENV-2 replicons could partially restore the replication defect of some lethal NS4A mutants (L26A and K80A), but not others (L60A and E122A), suggesting an unidentified mechanism governing the outcome of complementation in a mutant-dependent manner. Collectively, the results have demonstrated the importance of TMD1-mediated NS4A oligomerization in flavivirus replication. IMPORTANCE: We report that DENV NS4A forms oligomers. Such NS4A oligomerization is mediated mainly through amino acids 50 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain [TMD1]). The biological importance of NS4A oligomerization is demonstrated by results showing that mutations of flavivirus conserved residues (E50A and G67A located within TMD1) reduced the oligomerization and stability of the NS4A protein, leading to attenuated viral replication. A systematic mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that flavivirus conserved NS4A residues are important for DENV replication. A successful trans complementation of replication-lethal NS4A mutant virus requires wild-type NS4A in the context of the viral replication complex. The wild-type NS4A protein alone is not sufficient to rescue the replication defect of NS4A mutants. Intriguingly, distinct NS4A mutants yielded different complementation outcomes in the replicon-containing cells. Overall, the study has enhanced our understanding of flavivirus NS4A at the molecular level. The results also suggest that inhibitor blocking of NS4A oligomerization could be explored for antiviral drug discovery.

23637405,2013 Jul,Structural changes in dengue virus when exposed to a temperature of 37°C.,"Previous binding studies of antibodies that recognized a partially or fully hidden epitope suggest that insect cell-derived dengue virus undergoes structural changes at an elevated temperature. This was confirmed by our cryo-electron microscopy images of dengue virus incubated at 37°C, where viruses change their surface from smooth to rough. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of dengue virus at 37°C. Image analysis showed four classes of particles. The three-dimensional (3D) map of one of these classes, representing half of the imaged virus population, shows that the E protein shell has expanded and there is a hole at the 3-fold vertices. Fitting E protein structures into the map suggests that all of the interdimeric and some intradimeric E protein interactions are weakened. The accessibility of some previously found cryptic epitopes on this class of particles is discussed.

26096987,2015 Sep,Unstructural biology of the Dengue virus proteins.,"In this study, we used a wide spectrum of bioinformatics techniques to evaluate the extent of intrinsic disorder in the complete proteomes of genotypes of four human dengue virus (DENV), to analyze the peculiarities of disorder distribution within individual DENV proteins, and to establish potential roles for the structural disorder with respect to their functions. We show that several proteins (ER, E, 1, 2A and 4A) are predicted to be mostly ordered, whereas four proteins (C, 2k, NS3 and NS5) are expected to have high disorder levels. The profiles of disorder propensities are similar across the four genotypes, except for the NS5 protein. Cleavage sites are depleted in polymorphic sites, and have a high propensity for disorder, especially relative to neighboring residues. Disordered regions are highly polymorphic in type 1 DENV but have a relatively low number of polymorphic sites in the type 4 virus. There is a high density of polymorphisms in proteins 2A and 4A, which are depleted in disorder. Thus, a high density of polymorphism is not unique to disordered regions. Analysis of disorder/function association showed that the predominant function of the disordered regions in the DENV proteins is protein-protein interaction and binding of nucleic acids, metals and other small molecules. These regions are also associated with phosphorylation, which may regulate their function. Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia.

38693476,2024 May 1,DengueSeq: a pan-serotype whole genome amplicon sequencing protocol for dengue virus.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing burden of dengue virus on public health due to more explosive and frequent outbreaks highlights the need for improved surveillance and control. Genomic surveillance of dengue virus not only provides important insights into the emergence and spread of genetically diverse serotypes and genotypes, but it is also critical to monitor the effectiveness of newly implemented control strategies. Here, we present DengueSeq, an amplicon sequencing protocol, which enables whole-genome sequencing of all four dengue virus serotypes. RESULTS: We developed primer schemes for the four dengue virus serotypes, which can be combined into a pan-serotype approach. We validated both approaches using genetically diverse virus stocks and clinical specimens that contained a range of virus copies. High genome coverage (>95%) was achieved for all genotypes, except DENV2 (genotype VI) and DENV 4 (genotype IV) sylvatics, with similar performance of the serotype-specific and pan-serotype approaches. The limit of detection to reach 70% coverage was 10-100 RNA copies/μL for all four serotypes, which is similar to other commonly used primer schemes. DengueSeq facilitates the sequencing of samples without known serotypes, allows the detection of multiple serotypes in the same sample, and can be used with a variety of library prep kits and sequencing instruments. CONCLUSIONS: DengueSeq was systematically evaluated with virus stocks and clinical specimens spanning the genetic diversity within each of the four dengue virus serotypes. The primer schemes can be plugged into existing amplicon sequencing workflows to facilitate the global need for expanded dengue virus genomic surveillance.

32069280,2020 Feb,Evaluation of a novel microfluidic immuno-magnetic agglutination assay method for detection of dengue virus NS1 antigen.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important arbovirus worldwide, causing infections in endemic countries and returning travellers from these areas. Rapid diagnostic tests are needed to improve patient management and monitor local transmission. The detection of DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a useful tool for the diagnosis, but the currently available methods can be time consuming or lack sensitivity. The objective of our study was to evaluate a new rapid and semi-quantitative microfluidic DENV NS1 immuno-magnetic agglutination assay based on aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles detected by an electronic reader (Virotrack Dengue Acute and Blubox, Blusense diagnostics, Copenhagen, Denmark). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A panel of 135 serum samples from travelers returning from dengue endemic countries was analyzed (74 DENV positive samples including the four DENV serotypes, 26 Zika virus positive samples, 25 chikungunya virus positive samples, 5 malaria positive samples and 5 negative samples). Samples were tested by three different antigen detection methods: SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo and ViroTrack Dengue Acute. The sensitivity observed for SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, ViroTrack Dengue Acute and SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo was 97.2%, 91.1% and 68.1%, respectively. All methods showed high specificity (98.4% for ViroTrack Dengue Acute and 100% for both SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA and SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo). SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA and ViroTrack Dengue Acute only failed to detect samples positive for DENV-2. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: ViroTrack Dengue Acute is a sensitive and specific assay for DENV NS1 detection. It provides faster results than the ELISA method and a better performance than the rapid immunochromatographic tests. ViroTrack Dengue Acute could represent a valuable tool for rapid diagnosis of DENV infections in returning travellers from endemic countries. Clinic, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

24667083,2015 Jan,Maiden outbreaks of dengue virus 1 genotype III in rural central India.,"Dengue is regarded as the most important arboviral disease. Although sporadic cases have been reported, serotypes responsible for outbreaks have not been identified from central India over the last 20 years. We investigated two outbreaks of febrile illness, in August and November 2012, from Korea district (Chhattisgarh) and Narsinghpur district (Madhya Pradesh), respectively. Fever and entomological surveys were conducted in the affected regions. Molecular and serological tests were conducted on collected serum samples. Dengue-specific amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. In Korea and Narsinghpur districts 37·3% and 59% of cases were positive, respectively, for dengue infection, with adults being the worst affected. RT-PCR confirmed dengue virus serotype 1 genotype III as the aetiology. Ninety-six percent of infections were primary. This is the first time that dengue virus 1 outbreaks have been documented from central India. Introduction of the virus into the population and a conducive mosquitogenic environment favouring increased vector density caused the outbreak.

20937790,2011 Jan,"Novel dengue virus-specific NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitor, BP2109, discovered by a high-throughput screening assay.","Dengue virus (DENV) causes disease globally, with an estimated 25 to 100 million new infections per year. At present, no effective vaccine is available, and treatment is supportive. In this study, we identified BP2109, a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of the DENV NS2B/NS3 protease, by a high-throughput screening assay using a recombinant protease complex consisting of the central hydrophilic portion of NS2B and the N terminus of the protease domain. BP2109 inhibited DENV (serotypes 1 to 4), but not Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), replication and viral RNA synthesis without detectable cytotoxicity. The compound inhibited recombinant DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 15.43 ± 2.12 μM and reduced the reporter expression of the DENV-2 replicon with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 0.17 ± 0.01 μM. Sequencing analyses of several individual clones derived from BP2109-resistant DENV-2 RNAs revealed that two amino acid substitutions (R55K and E80K) are found in the region of NS2B, a cofactor of the NS2B/NS3 protease complex. The introduction of R55K and E80K double mutations into the dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease and a dengue virus replicon construct conferred 10.3- and 73.8-fold resistance to BP2109, respectively. The E80K mutation was further determined to be the key mutation conferring dengue virus replicon resistance (61.3-fold) to BP2109, whereas the R55K mutation alone did not affect resistance to BP2109. Both the R55K and E80K mutations are located in the central hydrophilic portion of the NS2B cofactor, where extensive interactions with the NS3pro domain exist. Thus, our data provide evidence that BP2109 likely inhibits DENV by a novel mechanism.

As such, a severe dengue outbreak appeared in Pakistan in 2011, particularly in Punjab province with Lahore as the most hit city (290 deaths). In 2013, for the first time in the history of Pakistan, dengue outbreak erupted in Swat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which claimed more than 57 lives. Hence this study was conducted to document circulating serotypes of dengue virus in Pakistan in 2011 and 2013 dengue outbreaks in two different territories/areas of the country. METHODS: In total, 1340 blood samples from people having dengue (ELISA positive) and/or dengue like symptoms from various cities/areas of Punjab and Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) were collected and analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using serotype specific primers. RESULTS: The results indicated that all the four dengue virus serotypes were circulating in Punjab Province with highest frequency of DENV-2 (41.64 %) and DENV-3 (41.05 %). Similarly, DENV-2 (41.66 %) and DENV-3 (35.0 %) were dominant serotypes detected in KP-based people lived in Punjab. On the other hand only DENV-2 (40.0 %) and DENV-3 (60.0 %) were detected in Swat District. Furthermore an important observation noted in this study was mixed infection of DENV-2 and DENV-3 in Punjab in 2011 (3.81 %) and in people from KP infected in Punjab (8.33 %) which may account for the high mortality and morbidity rates as compared to previous outbreaks. Over all male population was mostly infected as compared to females and people in the age group between 15 to 45 was the highest infected group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that all four serotypes of dengue virus are circulating in Punjab whereas serotypes 2 and 3 introduced for the first time into Swat, KP in 2013; about 600 km away from Lahore, Punjab. Overall dengue virus serotypes 2 and 3 were the major outbreak-causing serotypes in Pakistan in 2011 and 2013. Dengue outbreak in Swat may be the continuation of previous dengue outbreaks in Punjab but it needs further research and investigation. Lahore-53700, Pakistan. amjadaliswat@gmail.com.

32764809,2020,Rapid genotyping protocol to improve dengue virus serotype 2 survey in Lao PDR.,"Dengue fever is one of the major public health problems in Lao PDR. Over the last decade, dengue virus (DENV) epidemics were characterized by a novel predominant serotype accompanied by at least two other serotypes. Since 2008, DENV-2 circulated at a low level in Lao PDR but its epidemiologic profile changed at the end of 2018. Indeed, the number of confirmed DENV-2 cases suddenly increased in October 2018 and DENV-2 became predominant at the country level in early 2019. We developed a Genotype Screening Protocol (GSP) to determine the origin(s) of the Lao DENV-2 and study their genetic polymorphism. With a good correlation with full envelope gene sequencing data, this molecular epidemiology tool evidence the co-circulation of two highly polymorphic DENV-2 genotypes, i.e. Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, over the last five years, suggesting multiple introductions of DENV-2 in the country. GSP approach provides relevant first line information that may help countries with limited laboratory resources to reinforce their capabilities to DENV-2 and to follow the epidemics progresses and assess situations at the regional level.","['Dengue Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Genotyping Techniques/*methods', 'Humans', 'Laos', 'Serotyping', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']","['Dengue fever is one of the major public health problems in Lao PDR.', 'Over the last decade, dengue virus (DENV) epidemics were characterized by a novel predominant serotype accompanied by at least two other serotypes.', 'Since 2008, DENV-2 circulated at a low level in Lao PDR but its epidemiologic profile changed at the end of 2018.', 'Indeed, the number of confirmed DENV-2 cases suddenly increased in October 2018 and DENV-2 became predominant at the country level in early 2019.', 'We developed a Genotype Screening Protocol (GSP) to determine the origin(s) of the Lao DENV-2 and study their genetic polymorphism.', 'With a good correlation with full envelope gene sequencing data, this molecular epidemiology tool evidence the co-circulation of two highly polymorphic DENV-2 genotypes, i.e. Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, over the last five years, suggesting multiple introductions of DENV-2 in the country.', 'GSP approach provides relevant first line information that may help countries with limited laboratory resources to reinforce their capabilities to DENV-2 and to follow the epidemics progresses and assess situations at the regional level.']"
23226444,2012,Release of dengue virus genome induced by a peptide inhibitor.,"Dengue virus infects approximately 100 million people annually, but there is no available therapeutic treatment. The mimetic peptide, DN59, consists of residues corresponding to the membrane interacting, amphipathic stem region of the dengue virus envelope (E) glycoprotein. This peptide is inhibitory to all four serotypes of dengue virus, as well as other flaviviruses. Cryo-electron microscopy image reconstruction of dengue virus particles incubated with DN59 showed that the virus particles were largely empty, concurrent with the formation of holes at the five-fold vertices. The release of RNA from the viral particle following incubation with DN59 was confirmed by increased sensitivity of the RNA genome to exogenous RNase and separation of the genome from the E protein in a tartrate density gradient. DN59 interacted strongly with synthetic lipid vesicles and caused membrane disruptions, but was found to be non-toxic to mammalian and insect cells. Thus DN59 inhibits flavivirus infectivity by interacting directly with virus particles resulting in release of the genomic RNA.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/*genetics/pathogenicity/ultrastructure', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipid Bilayers/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/drug effects/metabolism']","['Dengue virus infects approximately 100 million people annually, but there is no available therapeutic treatment.', 'The mimetic peptide, DN59, consists of residues corresponding to the membrane interacting, amphipathic stem region of the dengue virus envelope (E) glycoprotein.', 'This peptide is inhibitory to all four serotypes of dengue virus, as well as other flaviviruses.', 'Cryo-electron microscopy image reconstruction of dengue virus particles incubated with DN59 showed that the virus particles were largely empty, concurrent with the formation of holes at the five-fold vertices.', 'The release of RNA from the viral particle following incubation with DN59 was confirmed by increased sensitivity of the RNA genome to exogenous RNase and separation of the genome from the E protein in a tartrate density gradient.', 'DN59 interacted strongly with synthetic lipid vesicles and caused membrane disruptions, but was found to be non-toxic to mammalian and insect cells.', 'Thus DN59 inhibits flavivirus infectivity by interacting directly with virus particles resulting in release of the genomic RNA.']"

25343372,2014,Dengue virus 1 in Buenos Aires from 1999 to 2010: towards local spread.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a public health problem representing the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. In Argentina, Northern provinces have reported autochthonous cases since 1997, though these outbreaks have originated in bordering countries, where co-circulation of more than one serotype has been reported. In the last decade, imported dengue cases have been reported in Buenos Aires, the urban area of Argentina with the highest population density. In 2009, a dengue outbreak affected Buenos Aires and, for the first time, local transmission was detected. All cases of this outbreak were caused by DENV-1. In this report, we present the full-length sequences of 27 DENV-1 isolates, corresponding to imported cases of 1999-2000, as well as local and imported cases of the 2009 and 2010 outbreaks. We analyzed their phylogenetic and phylodynamic relationships and their global and local spread. Additionally, we characterized their genomic and phenotypic features. All cases belonged to DENV-1 genotype V. The most recent ancestor for this genotype was dated ∼1934, whereas that for the 2009 outbreak was dated ∼2007. The mean rates of nucleotide substitution were 4.98E-4 and 8.53E-4 subs./site/yr, respectively. We inferred an introduction from Paraguay in 1999-2000 and mainly from Venezuela during 2009-2010. Overall, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site significantly exceeded the number of non-synonymous substitutions per site and 12 positively selected sites were detected.

34091710,2021 Oct,Enhancing sensitivity of QCM for dengue type 1 virus detection using graphene-based polymer composites.,"Graphene oxide-molecularly imprinted polymer composites (GO-MIP) have attracted significant attention as recognition materials in sensing due to their outstanding properties in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity, high mechanical modulus, and the comparably straightforward way to functionalize them. The aim of this study was to design a MIP-based sensor recognition material and enhance its sensitivity by blending it with GO for sensing a harmful dengue hemorrhagic fever pathogen, namely the dengue type 1 virus (DENV-1). Polymer composites comprising GO incorporated to an acrylamide (AAM)/methacrylic acid (MAA)/methyl methacrylate (MMA)/N-vinylpyrrolidone (VP) copolymer were synthesized and compared to the ""pure"" MIP, i.e., the copolymer without GO. The pure polymer revealed a zeta potential of + 9.9 ± 0.5 mV, whereas GO sheets prepared have a zeta potential of - 60.3 ± 2.7 mV. This results in an overall zeta potential of - 11.2 ± 0.2 mV of the composite. Such polymer composites seem appropriate to bind the positively charged DENV-1 particle (+ 42.2 ± 2.8 mV). GO-MIP coated onto 10-MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors indeed revealed two times sensitivity compared to sensors based on the pure MIP. Furthermore, GO-polymer composites revealed imprinting factors of up to 21, compared to 3 of the pure MIP. When plotting the sensor characteristic in a semilogarithmic way, the composite sensor shows the linear response to DENV-1 in the concentration range from 10(0) to 10(3) pfu mL(-1). The corresponding limits of detection (S/N = 3) and quantification (S/N = 10) are 0.58 and 1.94 pfu mL(-1), respectively.

14696333,2003,Microevolution and virulence of dengue viruses.,"The evolution of dengue viruses has had a major impact on their virulence for humans and on the epidemiology of dengue disease around the world. Although antigenic and genetic differences in virus strains had become evident, it is mainly due to the lack of animal models of disease that has made it difficult to detect differences in virulence of dengue viruses. However, phylogenetic studies of many different dengue virus samples have led to the association between specific genotypes (within serotypes) and the presentation of more or less severe disease. Currently, dengue viruses can be classified as being of epidemiologically low, medium, or high impact; i.e., some viruses may remain in sylvatic cycles of little or low transmissibility to humans, others produce dengue fever (DF) only, and some genotypes have been associated with the potential to cause the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in addition to DF. Although the factors that contribute to dengue virus epidemiology are complex, studies have suggested that specific viral structures may contribute to increased replication in human target cells and to increased transmission by the mosquito vector; however, the immune status and possibly the genetic background of the host are also determinants of virulence or disease presentation. As to the question of whether dengue viruses are evolving toward virulence as they continue to spread throughout the world, phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses suggest that the more virulent genotypes are now displacing those that have lower epidemiological impact; there is no evidence for the transmission of antigenically aberrant, new strains.","['Animals', 'Dengue/epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*genetics/*pathogenicity', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Serotyping', 'Virulence']","['The evolution of dengue viruses has had a major impact on their virulence for humans and on the epidemiology of dengue disease around the world.', 'Although antigenic and genetic differences in virus strains had become evident, it is mainly due to the lack of animal models of disease that has made it difficult to detect differences in virulence of dengue viruses.', 'However, phylogenetic studies of many different dengue virus samples have led to the association between specific genotypes (within serotypes) and the presentation of more or less severe disease.', 'Currently, dengue viruses can be classified as being of epidemiologically low, medium, or high impact; i.e., some viruses may remain in sylvatic cycles of little or low transmissibility to humans, others produce dengue fever (DF) only, and some genotypes have been associated with the potential to cause the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in addition to DF.', 'Although the factors that contribute to dengue virus epidemiology are complex, studies have suggested that specific viral structures may contribute to increased replication in human target cells and to increased transmission by the mosquito vector; however, the immune status and possibly the genetic background of the host are also determinants of virulence or disease presentation.', 'As to the question of whether dengue viruses are evolving toward virulence as they continue to spread throughout the world, phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses suggest that the more virulent genotypes are now displacing those that have lower epidemiological impact; there is no evidence for the transmission of antigenically aberrant, new strains', '.']"
19223625,2009 May,A small-molecule dengue virus entry inhibitor.,"The incidence of dengue fever epidemics has increased dramatically over the last few decades. However, no vaccine or antiviral therapies are available. Therefore, the need for safe and effective antiviral drugs has become imperative. The entry of dengue virus into a host cell is mediated by its major envelope (E) protein. The crystal structure of the E protein reveals a hydrophobic pocket that is presumably important for low-pH-mediated membrane fusion. High-throughput docking with this hydrophobic pocket was performed, and hits were evaluated in cell-based assays. Compound 6 was identified as one of the inhibitors and had an average 50% effective concentration of 119 nM against dengue virus serotype 2 in a human cell line. Mechanism-of-action studies demonstrated that compound 6 acts at an early stage during dengue virus infection. It arrests dengue virus in vesicles that colocalize with endocytosed dextran and inhibits NS3 expression. The inhibitors described in this report can serve as molecular probes for the study of the entry of flavivirus into host cells.

30341219,2018 Nov 6,Pervasive tertiary structure in the dengue virus RNA genome.,"RNA virus genomes are efficient and compact carriers of biological information, encoding information required for replication both in their primary sequences and in higher-order RNA structures. However, the ubiquity of RNA elements with higher-order folds-in which helices pack together to form complex 3D structures-and the extent to which these elements affect viral fitness are largely unknown. Here we used single-molecule correlated chemical probing to define secondary and tertiary structures across the RNA genome of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). Higher-order RNA structures are pervasive and involve more than one-third of nucleotides in the DENV2 genomic RNA. These 3D structures promote a compact overall architecture and contribute to viral fitness. Disrupting RNA regions with higher-order structures leads to stable, nonreverting mutants and could guide the development of vaccines based on attenuated RNA viruses. The existence of extensive regions of functional RNA elements with tertiary folds in viral RNAs, and likely many other messenger and noncoding RNAs, means that there are significant regions with pocket-containing surfaces that may serve as novel RNA-directed drug targets.

23627436,2013 Apr 29,Extract of Scutellaria baicalensis inhibits dengue virus replication.,"BACKGROUND: Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis) is one of the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs that have been shown to possess many health benefits. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of aqueous extract of the roots of S. baicalensis against all the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. METHODS: Aqueous extract of S. baicalensis was prepared by microwave energy steam evaporation method (MEGHE™), and the anti-dengue virus replication activity was evaluated using the foci forming unit reduction assay (FFURA) in Vero cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was used to determine the actual dengue virus RNA copy number. The presence of baicalein, a flavonoid known to inhibit dengue virus replication was determined by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The IC(50) values for the S. baicalensis extract on Vero cells following DENV adsorption ranged from 86.59 to 95.19 μg/mL for the different DENV serotypes. The IC(50) values decreased to 56.02 to 77.41 μg/mL when cells were treated with the extract at the time of virus adsorption for the different DENV serotypes. The extract showed potent direct virucidal activity against extracellular infectious virus particles with IC(50) that ranged from 74.33 to 95.83 μg/mL for all DENV serotypes. Weak prophylactic effects with IC(50) values that ranged from 269.9 to 369.8 μg/mL were noticed when the cells were pre-treated 2 hours prior to virus inoculation. The concentration of baicalein in the S. baicalensis extract was ~1% (1.03 μg/gm dried extract). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the in vitro anti-dengue virus replication property of S. baicalensis against all the four DENV serotypes investigated. The extract reduced DENV infectivity and replication in Vero cells. The extract was rich in baicalein, and could be considered for potential development of anti-DENV therapeutics.

27181378,2016 Jul,Novel antiviral activity of bromocriptine against dengue virus replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infectious disease is a major public health problem worldwide; however, licensed vaccines or specific antiviral drugs against this infection are not available. To identify novel anti-DENV compounds, we screened 1280 pharmacologically active compounds using focus reduction assay. Bromocriptine (BRC) was found to have potent anti-DENV activity and low cytotoxicity (half maximal effective concentration [EC50], 0.8-1.6 μM; and half maximal cytotoxicity concentration [CC50], 53.6 μM). Time-of-drug-addition and time-of-drug-elimination assays suggested that BRC inhibits translation and/or replication steps in the DENV life cycle. A subgenomic replicon system was used to verify that BRC restricts RNA replication step. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution (N374H) was detected in the NS3 protein that conferred resistance to BRC. In summary, BRC was found to be a novel DENV inhibitor and a potential candidate for the treatment of DENV infectious disease.

27313500,2016,Glycosphingolipid GM3 is Indispensable for Dengue Virus Genome Replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are involved in virus infection by regulating various steps of viral-host interaction. However, the distinct role of GSLs during DENV infection remains unclear. In this study, we used mouse melanoma B16 cells and their GSL-deficient mutant counterpart GM95 cells to study the influence of GSLs on DENV infection. Surprisingly, GM95 cells were highly resistant to DENV infection compared with B16 cells. Pretreatment of B16 cells with synthetase inhibitor of GM3, the most abundant GSLs in B16 cells, or silencing GM3 synthetase T3GAL5, significantly inhibited DENV infection. DENV attachment and endocytosis were not impaired in GM95 cells, but DENV genome replication was obviously inhibited in GM95 cells compared to B16 cells. Furthermore, GM3 was colocalized with DENV viral replication complex on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inside the B16 cells. Finally, GM3 synthetase inhibitor significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling mice that challenged with DENV by impairing the viral replication in mouse brain. Taken together, these data indicated that GM3 was not required for DENV attachment and endocytosis, however, essential for viral genome replication. Targeting GM3 could be a novel strategy to inhibit DENV infection. Infection and Immunity, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, P.R. China.

25241250,2014 Nov,Crystal structure of dengue virus methyltransferase without S-adenosyl-L-methionine.,"Flavivirus methyltransferase is a genetically-validated antiviral target. Crystal structures of almost all available flavivirus methyltransferases contain S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor molecule that co-purifies with the enzymes. This raises a possibility that SAM is an integral structural component required for the folding of dengue virus (DENV) methyltransferase. Here we exclude this possibility by solving the crystal structure of DENV methyltransferase without SAM. The SAM ligand was removed from the enzyme through a urea-mediated denaturation-and-renaturation protocol. The crystal structure of the SAM-depleted enzyme exhibits a vacant SAM-binding pocket, with a conformation identical to that of the SAM-enzyme co-crystal structure. Functionally, equivalent enzymatic activities (N-7 methylation, 2'-O methylation, and GMP-enzyme complex formation) were detected for the SAM-depleted and SAM-containing recombinant proteins. These results clearly indicate that the SAM molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of DENV methyltransferase. Furthermore, the results imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the SAM-binding pocket and compete against SAM binding. To demonstrate this potential, we have soaked crystals of DENV methyltransferase without a bound SAM with the natural product Sinefungin and show that preformed crystals are capable of binding ligands in this pocket.

25860459,2015 Jan-Feb,"Natural transovarial transmission of dengue virus 4 in Aedes aegypti from Cuiabá, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil.","INTRODUCTION: Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease in tropical areas. In Mato Grosso, outbreaks are reported every year, but studies on dengue in this state are scarce. METHODS: Natural transovarial infection of Aedes aegypti by a flavivirus was investigated in the Jardim Industriário neighborhood of Cuiabá, Mato Grosso. Eggs were collected with ovitraps during the dry, intermediate, and rainy seasons of 2012. After the eggs hatched and the larvae developed to adulthood, mosquitoes (n = 758) were identified and allocated to pools of 1-10 specimens according to the collection location, sex, and climatic period. After RNA extraction, multiplex semi-nested RT-PCR was performed to detect the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus. RESULTS: DENV-4 was the only flavivirus detected, and it was found in 8/50 pools (16.0%). Three of the positive pools contained females, and five contained males. Their nucleotide sequences presented 96-100% similarity with DENV-4 genotype II strains from Manaus, Amazonas. The minimum infection rate was 10.5 per 1000 specimens, and the maximum likelihood estimator of the infection rate was 11.6 (95% confidence interval: 4.8; 23.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of natural transovarial infection by DENV-4 in Ae. Aegypti in Mato Grosso, suggesting that this type of infection might serve as a mechanism of virus maintenance during interepidemic periods in Cuiabá, a city where dengue epidemics are reported every year.

15542360,2004 Dec 2,Inactivation of dengue virus by methylene blue/narrow bandwidth light system.,"Peracetic acid was one of the most commonly used disinfectants on solid surfaces in hospitals or public places. However, peracetic acid is an environmental toxin. Therefore, safer, alternative disinfectants or disinfectant systems should be developed. Because photodynamic virus inactivation with methylene blue (MB)/light system has proven effective in blood banking, MB was selected as a photosensitizing agent, dengue virus as a model virus for enveloped RNA viruses, and an in-house fabricated narrow bandwidth light system overlapping the absorption spectrum of MB as the light source. Dengue virus was mixed with different concentrations of MB, and illuminated by the narrow bandwidth light system under different illumination distances and times. The amount of dengue virus remaining was evaluated by plaque forming assays. Results showed that the concentration of MB working solution, illumination intensity of light source, illumination distance and time were four key factors affecting efficiency of virus inactivation using the MB/narrow bandwidth light system. Dengue virus could be completely inactivated at 2.5 m in 5 min when MB >/= 1.0 microg/ml. However, when the distance reached 3.0 m, only greater concentrations of MB (2.0 microg/ml) could completely inactivate virus in a reasonably short time (20 min), and smaller concentrations of MB (1.0 microg/ml) could only completely inactivate virus using longer times (25 min). The results of this virus inactivation model indicate that our MB/narrow bandwidth light system provides a powerful, easy way to inactivate dengue viruses.

12454138,2002 Dec,Detection of dengue virus replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from dengue virus type 2-infected patients by a reverse transcription-real-time PCR assay.,"While dengue virus is thought to replicate in mononuclear phagocytic cells in vivo, attempts to detect it in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by virus isolation or antigen detection have had variable and generally low rates. In this study, we developed a reverse transcription (RT)-real-time PCR assay to quantify positive- and negative-sense RNA of dengue virus type 2 within the cells. The assay includes an RT step using either sense or antisense primer followed by a real-time PCR step using the designed primers and probe, which target a capsid region highly conserved in dengue virus type 2 strains. It can be used to monitor the dynamic change of intracellular dengue virus RNA species during the course of infection. When this assay is employed in quantification of dengue virus RNA species in PBMC from 10 patients infected with dengue virus type 2, both positive- and negative-sense dengue RNA can be detected, indicating that dengue virus is actively replicating in PBMC in vivo. Moreover, the amounts of negative-sense dengue virus RNA in PBMC correlate very well with the viral load of dengue virus in plasma, suggesting that quantification of negative-sense dengue virus RNA in PBMC may provide another indicator of dengue virus replication in vivo. Use of this convenient, sensitive, and accurate method of quantification in clinical samples from patients with different disease severity would further our understanding of the pathogenesis of dengue.

18281221,2008 Feb,Phylogenetic study of dengue-3 virus in Taiwan with sequence analysis of the core gene.,"Dengue virus serotype 3 (dengue-3) has been classified into five genotypes (I-V) by phylogenetic analysis based on different viral genes. To investigate the genetic variability and evolutionary character of the dengue-3 isolates in southern Taiwan from 2005 to 2006, we analyzed the 290 nucleotides of the core (C) gene of 12 dengue-3 isolates and compared them with the published C gene sequences of global dengue-3 strains available in GenBank, including four isolates from 1998 and one isolate from 1999, from Taiwan. The dengue-3 viruses from 2005 to 2006 were not from continuous spread of an epidemic strain or re-emergence of the 2005 strains in the 2-year period because there was a 5.4-6.2% difference in the 290 nucleotides of the C gene and different genotypes between the 2005 and 2006 strains. Most of the nucleotide changes, compared with a prototype dengue-3 virus, H87, occurred in the third codon position and were non-synonymous mutations occurring naturally in the C gene. In addition, there was no consistent difference in the 290 nucleotides of the C gene between eight dengue fever and two dengue hemorrhagic fever isolates from 2006. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the isolates from the 1998, 1999 and 2006 Taiwan dengue-3 epidemics are phylogenetically related and belong to genotype III. It was noted that the 2005 Taiwan dengue-3 isolates belong to another genotype.

28956770,2017 Dec 1,Genome-Wide Mutagenesis of Dengue Virus Reveals Plasticity of the NS1 Protein and Enables Generation of Infectious Tagged Reporter Viruses.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a major global pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. An improved understanding of the regions within the DENV genome and its encoded proteins that are required for the virus replication cycle will expedite the development of urgently required therapeutics and vaccines. We subjected an infectious DENV genome to unbiased insertional mutagenesis and used next-generation sequencing to identify sites that tolerate 15-nucleotide insertions during the virus replication cycle in hepatic cell culture. This revealed that the regions within capsid, NS1, and the 3' untranslated region were the most tolerant of insertions. In contrast, prM- and NS2A-encoding regions were largely intolerant of insertions. Notably, the multifunctional NS1 protein readily tolerated insertions in regions within the Wing, connector, and β-ladder domains with minimal effects on viral RNA replication and infectious virus production. Using this information, we generated infectious reporter viruses, including a variant encoding the APEX2 electron microscopy tag in NS1 that uniquely enabled high-resolution imaging of its localization to the surface and interior of viral replication vesicles. In addition, we generated a tagged virus bearing an mScarlet fluorescent protein insertion in NS1 that, despite an impact on fitness, enabled live cell imaging of NS1 localization and traffic in infected cells. Overall, this genome-wide profile of DENV genome flexibility may be further dissected and exploited in reporter virus generation and antiviral strategies.IMPORTANCE Regions of genetic flexibility in viral genomes can be exploited in the generation of reporter virus tools and should arguably be avoided in antiviral drug and vaccine design. Here, we subjected the DENV genome to high-throughput insertional mutagenesis to identify regions of genetic flexibility and enable tagged reporter virus generation. In particular, the viral NS1 protein displayed remarkable tolerance of small insertions. This genetic flexibility enabled generation of several novel NS1-tagged reporter viruses, including an APEX2-tagged virus that we used in high-resolution imaging of NS1 localization in infected cells by electron microscopy. For the first time, this analysis revealed the localization of NS1 within viral replication factories known as ""vesicle packets"" (VPs), in addition to its acknowledged localization to the luminal surface of these VPs. Together, this genetic profile of DENV may be further refined and exploited in the identification of antiviral targets and the generation of reporter virus tools.

30291875,2019 Feb,One-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detection and typing of dengue virus.,"Previous studies reported that severity of dengue is associated with multiple factors, including secondary infection, age, viral load and infecting serotype and genotype. In addition, other studies have reported that a dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) infection is associated with a prognosis of more severe clinical manifestations than DENV-1 and DENV-4 infections. For these reasons, the ability to identify the DENV serotypes is critical for optimal patient diagnosis and epidemiological studies. In this study, we developed a TaqMan probe-based, one-step real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system for detection and serotyping DENV. Our linear dynamic range (10(1) to 10(7) copies/reaction) showed the R(2) values of DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4 as 0.998, 0.998, 0.994, and 0.998, respectively. The detection limits of DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4, were 10 copies/reaction, 100 copies/reaction, 10 copies/reaction, and 100 copies/reaction, respectively. Specificity test results indicated that this system is specific for DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4 and does not react with other viruses. Finally, we validated our results with five different real-time PCR instruments. Our results showed that the Ct values of the four serotype templates were similar in five real-time PCR instruments. Thus, this system provides an accurate method for detection and serotyping of DENV, which can be applied in diagnostics, surveillance, and epidemiology.

14612562,2003 Nov 25,Inhibition of interferon signaling by dengue virus.,"Dengue virus is a worldwide-distributed mosquito-borne flavivirus with a positive strand RNA genome. Its transcribed polyprotein is cleaved by host- and virus-encoded peptidases into 10 proteins, some of which are of unknown function. Although dengue virus-infected cells seem to be resistant to the antiviral action of IFN, the viral products that mediate this resistance are unknown. Therefore, we have analyzed the ability of the 10 dengue virus-encoded proteins to antagonize the IFN response. We found that expression in human A549 cells of the dengue virus nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS4A, or NS4B enhances replication of an IFN-sensitive virus. Moreover, expression of NS4B and, to a lesser extent, of NS2A and NS4A proteins results in down-regulation of IFN-beta-stimulated gene expression. Cells expressing NS4B or infected with dengue virus do not exhibit nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 on treatment with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, indicating that NS4B might be involved in blocking IFN signaling during dengue virus infections. This protein, encoded by a positive strand RNA virus, is implicated as an IFN-signaling inhibitor.

20606073,2010 Sep,Characterization of dengue virus resistance to brequinar in cell culture.,"Brequinar is an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Here we report that brequinar has activity against a broad spectrum of viruses. The compound not only inhibits flaviviruses (dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and Powassan virus) but also suppresses a plus-strand RNA alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus) and a negative-strand RNA rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus). Using dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model, we found that brequinar suppressed the viral infection cycle mainly at the step of RNA synthesis. Supplementing the culture medium with pyrimidines (cytidine or uridine) but not purines (adenine or guanine) could be used to reverse the inhibitory effect of the compound. Continuous culturing of DENV-2 in the presence of brequinar generated viruses that were partially resistant to the inhibitor. Sequencing of the resistant viruses revealed two amino acid mutations: one mutation (M260V) located at a helix in the domain II of the viral envelope protein and another mutation (E802Q) located at the priming loop of the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase domain. Functional analysis of the mutations suggests that the NS5 mutation exerts resistance through enhancement of polymerase activity.

27622791,2015 Oct 26,Dengue and Chikungunya differential diagnosis in pediatric patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue and Chikungunya infections have similar clinical symptoms, which makes their clinical diagnosis complex. Moreover, both are transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, which results in virus co-circulation and co-infection. However, the outcome of these diseases differs: Chikungunya fever is rarely fatal but can have permanent and severe rheumatic and neurological sequelae, whereas dengue disease is potentially fatal. Thus, accurate diagnosis is critical.  OBJECTIVE: To compare presumptive diagnoses based on clinical findings with the differential diagnoses based on specific laboratory tests for each virus.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed specific virological and serological tests for both dengue and Chikungunya infections on eight acute-phase blood samples collected from pediatric patients with febrile syndrome. We used RT-PCR to detect dengue and Chikungunya virus, and IgM-capture ELISA to confirm infection by dengue virus.  RESULTS: Based on clinical findings, two patients were diagnosed as probable cases of dengue or Chikungunya, and two were diagnosed as probable cases of chikungunya. Four had no presumptive diagnosis of viral infection. Laboratory tests confirmed dengue infection in two patients, Chikungunya infection in two patients, and co-infection by the two viruses in the other four patients.  CONCLUSION: Clinical findings were not sufficient to make a diagnosis in pediatric patients with febrile syndrome; specific laboratory tests were required to establish the etiologic agent of the disease. calvoeliana@unbosque.edu.co.","['Chikungunya Fever/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Chikungunya virus/*chemistry', 'Child', 'Dengue/*diagnosis', 'Dengue Virus/*chemistry/*immunology', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans']","['INTRODUCTION: Dengue and Chikungunya infections have similar clinical symptoms, which makes their clinical diagnosis complex.', 'Moreover, both are transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, which results in virus co-circulation and co-infection.', 'However, the outcome of these diseases differs: Chikungunya fever is rarely fatal but can have permanent and severe rheumatic and neurological sequelae, whereas dengue disease is potentially fatal.', 'Thus, accurate diagnosis is critical.', 'OBJECTIVE: To compare presumptive diagnoses based on clinical findings with the differential diagnoses based on specific laboratory tests for each virus.', '', 'MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed specific virological and serological tests for both dengue and Chikungunya infections on eight acute-phase blood samples collected from pediatric patients with febrile syndrome.', 'We used RT-PCR to detect dengue and Chikungunya virus, and IgM-capture ELISA to confirm infection by dengue virus.', '', 'RESULTS: Based on clinical findings, two patients were diagnosed as probable cases of dengue or Chikungunya, and two were diagnosed as probable cases of chikungunya.', 'Four had no presumptive diagnosis of viral infection.', 'Laboratory tests confirmed dengue infection in two patients, Chikungunya infection in two patients, and co-infection by the two viruses in the other four patients.', 'CONCLUSION: Clinical findings were not sufficient to make a diagnosis in pediatric patients with febrile syndrome; specific laboratory tests were required to establish the etiologic agent of the disease. calvoeliana@unbosque.edu.co.']"
22405440,2012 Mar 9,Phylogenetic reconstruction of dengue virus type 2 in Colombia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is perhaps the most important viral re-emergent disease especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries, affecting about 50 million people around the world yearly. In Colombia, dengue virus was first detected in 1971 and still remains as a major public health issue. Although four viral serotypes have been recurrently identified, dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) has been involved in the most important outbreaks during the last 20 years, including 2010 when the fatality rate highly increased. As there are no major studies reviewing virus origin and genotype distribution in this country, the present study attempts to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of DENV-2 using a sequence analysis from a 224 bp PCR-amplified product corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the envelope (E) gene from 48 Colombian isolates. RESULTS: As expected, the oldest isolates belonged to the American genotype (subtype V), but the strains collected since 1990 represent the American/Asian genotype (subtype IIIb) as previously reported in different American countries. Interestingly, the introduction of this genotype coincides with the first report of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Colombia at the end of 1989 and the increase of cases during the next years. CONCLUSION: After replacement of the American genotype, several lineages of American/Asian subtype have rapidly spread all over the country evolving in new clades. Nevertheless, the direct association of these new variants in the raise of lethality rate observed during the last outbreak has to be demonstrated. 51-20, Bogotá, D.C.,Colombia. jmendez@ins.gov.co","['Colombia/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', '*Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']","['BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is perhaps the most important viral re-emergent disease especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries, affecting about 50 million people around the world yearly.', 'In Colombia, dengue virus was first detected in 1971 and still remains as a major public health issue.', 'Although four viral serotypes have been recurrently identified, dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) has been involved in the most important outbreaks during the last 20 years, including 2010 when the fatality rate highly increased.', 'As there are no major studies reviewing virus origin and genotype distribution in this country, the present study attempts to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of DENV-2 using a sequence analysis from a 224 bp PCR-amplified product corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the envelope (E) gene from 48 Colombian isolates.', 'RESULTS: As expected, the oldest isolates belonged to the American genotype (subtype V), but the strains collected since 1990 represent the American/Asian genotype (subtype IIIb) as previously reported in different American countries.', 'Interestingly, the introduction of this genotype coincides with the first report of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Colombia at the end of 1989 and the increase of cases during the next years.', 'CONCLUSION: After replacement of the American genotype, several lineages of American/Asian subtype have rapidly spread all over the country evolving in new clades.', 'Nevertheless, the direct association of these new variants in the raise of lethality rate observed during the last outbreak has to be demonstrated.', '51-20, Bogotá, D.C.,Colombia.', 'jmendez@ins.gov.co']"
9754275,1998 Jul-Aug,[Apoptotic cell death in response to dengue virus infection: what are the consequences of viral pathogenesis?].,"Dengue is a human disease of viral etiology which may be fatal in its hemorragic form. It is widely spread in the tropical areas of the different continents and has been dramatically expanding over the past 30 years. Although an immunological disorder is thought to be involved in dengue physiological symptoms, the pathogenesis of dengue hemorragic fever has not yet been elucidated. Whether the immune response is deleterious or beneficial to the host remains a matter of debate. Other factors, related to virus replication in specific host cells, could also contribute to the severity of the disease. Apoptotic cell death is one of the important consequences of dengue virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Dengue replication triggers apoptotic signals in neurons and hepatocytes although the original effectors and kinetics differ. Implications of the ongoing apoptotic processes in viral pathogenesis will be further discussed. dengue: quelles conséquences dans la pathogénie virale?","['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Dengue/etiology/*pathology', 'Dengue Virus/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Liver/virology', 'Neurons/virology', 'Virus Replication']","['Dengue is a human disease of viral etiology which may be fatal in its hemorragic form.', 'It is widely spread in the tropical areas of the different continents and has been dramatically expanding over the past 30 years.', 'Although an immunological disorder is thought to be involved in dengue physiological symptoms, the pathogenesis of dengue hemorragic fever has not yet been elucidated.', 'Whether the immune response is deleterious or beneficial to the host remains a matter of debate.', 'Other factors, related to virus replication in specific host cells, could also contribute to the severity of the disease.', 'Apoptotic cell death is one of the important consequences of dengue virus infection both in vitro and in vivo.', 'Dengue replication triggers apoptotic signals in neurons and hepatocytes although the original effectors and kinetics differ.', 'Implications of the ongoing apoptotic processes in viral pathogenesis will be further discussed.', 'dengue: quelles conséquences dans la pathogénie virale?']"
30528666,2019 Jul,Isolation and molecular characterization of dengue virus clinical isolates from pediatric patients in New Delhi.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the in vitro replication fitness, viral diversity, and phylogeny of dengue viruses (DENV) isolated from Indian patients. METHODS: DENV was isolated from whole blood collected from patients by passaging in cell culture. Passage 3 viruses were used for growth kinetics in C6/36 mosquito cells. Parallel efforts also focused on the isolation of DENV RNA from plasma samples of the same patients, which were processed for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: It was possible to isolate 64 clinical isolates of DENV, mostly DENV-2. Twenty-five of these were further used for growth curve analysis in vitro, which showed a wide range of replication kinetics. The highest viral titers were associated with isolates from patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue cases. Full genome sequences of 21 DENV isolates were obtained. Genome analysis mapped the circulating DENV-2 strains to the Cosmopolitan genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The replication kinetics of isolates from patients with mild or severe infection did not differ significantly, but the viral titers varied by two orders of magnitude between the isolates, suggesting differences in replication fitness among the circulating DENV-2.

24903593,2014 Jun,Critical role of Dengue Virus NS1 protein in viral replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a highly conserved 46-kDa protein that contains 2 glycosylation sites (Asn-130 and Asn-207) and 12 conserved cysteine (Cys) residues. Here, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate systematic mutants of viral strain TSV01. The results of the subsequent analysis showed that an alanine substitution at the second N-linked glycan Asn-207 in NS1 delayed viral RNA synthesis, reduced virus plaque size, and weakened the cytopathic effect. Three mutants at Cys sites (Cys-4, Cys-55, Cys-291) and a C-terminal deletion (ΔC) mutant significantly impaired RNA synthesis, and consequently abolished viral growth, whereas alanine mutations at Asn-130 and Glu-173 resulted in phenotypes that were similar to the wild-type (WT) virus. Further analysis showed that the Asn-207 mutation slightly delayed viral replication. These results suggest that the three conserved disulfide bonds and the second N-linked glycan in NS1 are required for DENV-2 replication.

26872216,2016 Feb,"The Epidemiology, Virology and Clinical Findings of Dengue Virus Infections in a Cohort of Indonesian Adults in Western Java.","BACKGROUND: Dengue has emerged as one of the most important infectious diseases in the last five decades. Evidence indicates the expansion of dengue virus endemic areas and consequently the exponential increase of dengue virus infections across the subtropics. The clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection include sudden fever, rash, headache, myalgia and in more serious cases, spontaneous bleeding. These manifestations occur in children as well as in adults. Defining the epidemiology of dengue in a given area is critical to understanding the disease and devising effective public health strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the results from a prospective cohort study of 4380 adults in West Java, Indonesia, from 2000-2004 and 2006-2009. A total of 2167 febrile episodes were documented and dengue virus infections were confirmed by RT-PCR or serology in 268 cases (12.4%). The proportion ranged from 7.6 to 41.8% each year. The overall incidence rate of symptomatic dengue virus infections was 17.3 cases/1,000 person years and between September 2006 and April 2008 asymptomatic infections were 2.6 times more frequent than symptomatic infections. According to the 1997 WHO classification guidelines, there were 210 dengue fever cases, 53 dengue hemorrhagic fever cases (including one dengue shock syndrome case) and five unclassified cases. Evidence for sequential dengue virus infections was seen in six subjects. All four dengue virus serotypes circulated most years. Inapparent dengue virus infections were predominantly associated with DENV-4 infections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Dengue virus was responsible for a significant percentage of febrile illnesses in an adult population in West Java, Indonesia, and this percentage varied from year to year. The observed incidence rate during the study period was 43 times higher than the reported national or provincial rates during the same time period. A wide range of clinical severity was observed with most infections resulting in asymptomatic disease. The circulation of all four serotypes of dengue virus was observed in most years of the study.

25355881,2015 Jan,Structure of acidic pH dengue virus showing the fusogenic glycoprotein trimers.,"Flaviviruses undergo large conformational changes during their life cycle. Under acidic pH conditions, the mature virus forms transient fusogenic trimers of E glycoproteins that engage the lipid membrane in host cells to initiate viral fusion and nucleocapsid penetration into the cytoplasm. However, the dynamic nature of the fusogenic trimer has made the determination of its structure a challenge. Here we have used Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 to stop the conformational change of dengue virus at an intermediate stage of the fusion process. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that in this intermediate stage, the E glycoproteins form 60 trimers that are similar to the predicted ""open"" fusogenic trimer. IMPORTANCE: The structure of a dengue virus has been captured during the formation of fusogenic trimers. This was accomplished by binding Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 to the virus at neutral pH and then decreasing the pH to 5.5. These trimers had an ""open"" conformation, which is distinct from the ""closed"" conformation of postfusion trimers. Only two of the three E proteins within each spike are bound by a Fab molecule at domain III. Steric hindrance around the icosahedral 3-fold axes prevents binding of a Fab to the third domain III of each E protein spike. Binding of the DV2-E104 Fab fragments prevents domain III from rotating by about 130° to the postfusion orientation and thus precludes the stem region from ""zipping"" together the three E proteins along the domain II boundaries into the ""closed"" postfusion conformation, thus inhibiting fusion.

Molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) was used to calculate the relative binding free energies and to locate the key residues of peptide-protein interactions. The predicted binding affinity correlated well with the previous experimental studies. DET4 outperformed DET2 and is oriented within the binding site through favorable vdW and electrostatic interactions. Pairwise residue decomposition analysis has revealed several key residues that contribute to the binding of these peptides. Residues in DET2 interact relatively lesser with the domain III compared to DET4. Dynamic cross-correlation analysis showed that both the DET2 and DET4 trigger different dynamic patterns on the domain III. Correlated motions were seen between the residue pairs of DET4 and the binding site while binding of DET2 results in anti-correlated motion on the binding site.

28327521,2017 Mar 22,Potential Antivirals: Natural Products Targeting Replication Enzymes of Dengue and Chikungunya Viruses.,"Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are reemergent arboviruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus. During the last several decades, these viruses have been responsible for millions of cases of infection and thousands of deaths worldwide. Therefore, several investigations were conducted over the past few years to find antiviral compounds for the treatment of DENV and CHIKV infections. One attractive strategy is the screening of compounds that target enzymes involved in the replication of both DENV and CHIKV. In this review, we describe advances in the evaluation of natural products targeting the enzymes involved in the replication of these viruses.

30814437,2019 Sep 14,In vitro antiviral activity of spirotetronate compounds against dengue virus serotype 2.,"Spirotetronate compounds are polyketide secondary metabolites with diverse biological functions, such as antibacterial, antitumor and antiviral activities. Three pure spirotetronate compounds (2EPS-A, -B, -C) isolated from Actinomadura strain 2EPS showed inhibitory activity against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). 2EPS-A, -B and -C demonstrated the LC(50) values of 11.6, 27.5 and 12.0 μg/ml, respectively, in a test of cytotoxicity to Vero cells. The least cytotoxic, 2EPS-B, was further analyzed for its impact on viral propagation in a cell-based replication assay. At a concentration of 6.25 μg/ml, it could reduce the DENV-2 infection in Vero cells by about 94% when cells infected with DENV-2 were exposed to 2EPS-B, whereas direct treatment of DENV-2 with 2EPS-B at the same concentration prior to subsequent infection to Vero cell yielded no inhibition. 2EPS-A, -B an -C showed strong DENV-2 NS2B-NS3 protease inhibition in an in vitro assay, with IC(50) values of 1.94 ± 0.18, 1.47 ± 0.15 and 2.51 ± 0.21 μg/ml, respectively.

22757685,2012 Jul 31,Dengue virus nonstructural protein 5 adopts multiple conformations in solution.,"Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested. The results of these experiments also suggest that NS5 adopts multiple conformations in solution, ranging from compact to more extended forms in which the two domains do not seem to interact with each other. We interpret the multiple conformations of NS5 observed in solution as resulting from weak interactions between the two NS5 domains and flexibility of the linker in the absence of other components of the replication complex.

23593526,2013,Virus-specific differences in rates of disease during the 2010 Dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a potentially fatal acute febrile illness (AFI) caused by four mosquito-transmitted dengue viruses (DENV-1-4) that are endemic in Puerto Rico. In January 2010, the number of suspected dengue cases reported to the passive dengue surveillance system exceeded the epidemic threshold and an epidemic was declared soon after. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To characterize the epidemic, surveillance and laboratory diagnostic data were compiled. A suspected case was a dengue-like AFI in a person reported by a health care provider with or without a specimen submitted for diagnostic testing. Laboratory-positive cases had: (i) DENV nucleic acid detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an acute serum specimen; (ii) anti-DENV IgM antibody detected by ELISA in any serum specimen; or (iii) DENV antigen or nucleic acid detected in an autopsy-tissue specimen. In 2010, a total of 26,766 suspected dengue cases (7.2 per 1,000 residents) were identified, of which 46.6% were laboratory-positive. Of 7,426 RT-PCR-positive specimens, DENV-1 (69.0%) and DENV-4 (23.6%) were detected more frequently than DENV-2 (7.3%) and DENV-3 (<0.1%). Nearly half (47.1%) of all laboratory-positive cases were adults, 49.7% had dengue with warning signs, 11.1% had severe dengue, and 40 died. Approximately 21% of cases were primary DENV infections, and 1-4 year olds were the only age group for which primary infection was more common than secondary. Individuals infected with DENV-1 were 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-9.8) and 4.0 (95% CI: 2.4-6.5) times more likely to have primary infection than those infected with DENV-2 or -4, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This epidemic was long in duration and yielded the highest incidence of reported dengue cases and deaths since surveillance began in Puerto Rico in the late 1960's. This epidemic re-emphasizes the need for more effective primary prevention interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of dengue.

24522909,2014 May,Ultrastructural characterization and three-dimensional architecture of replication sites in dengue virus-infected mosquito cells.,"During dengue virus infection of host cells, intracellular membranes are rearranged into distinct subcellular structures such as double-membrane vesicles, convoluted membranes, and tubular structures. Recent electron tomographic studies have provided a detailed three-dimensional architecture of the double-membrane vesicles, representing the sites of dengue virus replication, but temporal and spatial evidence linking membrane morphogenesis with viral RNA synthesis is lacking. Integrating techniques in electron tomography and molecular virology, we defined an early period in virus-infected mosquito cells during which the formation of a virus-modified membrane structure, the double-membrane vesicle, is proportional to the rate of viral RNA synthesis. Convoluted membranes were absent in dengue virus-infected C6/36 cells. Electron tomographic reconstructions elucidated a high-resolution view of the replication complexes inside vesicles and allowed us to identify distinct pathways of particle formation. Hence, our findings extend the structural details of dengue virus replication within mosquito cells and highlight their differences from mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE: Dengue virus induces several distinct intracellular membrane structures within the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. These structures, including double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, are linked, respectively, with viral replication and viral protein processing. However, dengue virus cycles between two disparate animal groups with differing physiologies: mammals and mosquitoes. Using techniques in electron microscopy, we examined the differences between intracellular structures induced by dengue virus in mosquito cells. Additionally, we utilized techniques in molecular virology to temporally link events in virus replication to the formation of these dengue virus-induced membrane structures.

32054488,2020 Feb 13,Assessment of a multiplex PCR and Nanopore-based method for dengue virus sequencing in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infects hundreds of thousands of people annually in Indonesia. However, DENV sequence data from the country are limited, as samples from outbreaks must be shipped across long-distances to suitably equipped laboratories to be sequenced. This approach is time-consuming, expensive, and frequently results in failure due to low viral load or degradation of the RNA genome. METHODS: We evaluated a method designed to address this challenge, using the 'Primal Scheme' multiplex PCR tiling approach to rapidly generate short, overlapping amplicons covering the complete DENV coding-region, and sequencing the amplicons on the portable Nanopore MinION device. The resulting sequence data was assessed in terms of genome coverage, consensus sequence accuracy and by phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The multiplex approach proved capable of producing near complete coding-region coverage from all samples tested ([Formula: see text] = 99.96%, n = 18), 61% of which could not be fully amplified using the current, long-amplicon PCR, approach. Nanopore-generated consensus sequences were found to be between 99.17-99.92% identical to those produced by high-coverage Illumina sequencing. Consensus accuracy could be improved by masking regions below 20X coverage depth (99.69-99.92%). However, coding-region coverage was reduced at this depth ([Formula: see text] = 93.48%). Nanopore and Illumina consensus sequences generated from the same samples formed monophyletic clades on phylogenetic analysis, and Indonesian consensus sequences accurately clustered by geographical origin. CONCLUSION: The multiplex, short-amplicon approach proved superior for amplifying DENV genomes from clinical samples, particularly when the virus was present at low concentrations. The accuracy of Nanopore-generated consensus sequences from these amplicons was sufficient for identifying the geographic origin of the samples, demonstrating that the approach can be a useful tool for identifying and monitoring DENV clades circulating in low-resource settings across Indonesia. However, the inaccuracies in Nanopore-generated consensus sequences mean that the approach may not be appropriate for higher resolution transmission studies, particularly when more accurate sequencing technologies are available.

31092581,2019 Aug 1,Infection of Aedes albopictus Mosquito C6/36 Cells with the wMelpop Strain of Wolbachia Modulates Dengue Virus-Induced Host Cellular Transcripts and Induces Critical Sequence Alterations in the Dengue Viral Genome.,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes frequent epidemics infecting ∼390 million people annually in over 100 countries. There are no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs for treatment of infected patients. However, there is a novel approach to control DENV transmission by the mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, using the Wolbachia symbiont. The wMelPop strain of Wolbachia suppresses DENV transmission and shortens the mosquito life span. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To clarify this mechanism, either naive A. albopictus (C6/36) or wMelPop-C6/36 cells were infected with DENV serotype 2 (DENV2). Analysis of host transcript profiles by transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) revealed that the presence of wMelPop dramatically altered the mosquito host cell transcription in response to DENV2 infection. The viral RNA evolved from wMelPop-C6/36 cells contained low-frequency mutations (∼25%) within the coding region of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) of E protein. Mutations with >97% frequencies were distributed within other regions of E, the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5POL) domain, and the TMDs of NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B. Moreover, while DENV2-infected naive C6/36 cells showed syncytium formation, DENV2-infected wMelPop-C6/36 cells did not. The Wolbachia-induced mutant DENV2 can readily infect and replicate in naive C6/36 cells, whereas in mutant DENV2-infected BHK-21 or Vero cells, virus replication was delayed. In LLC-MK2 cells, the mutant failed to produce plaques. Additionally, in BHK-21 cells, many mutations in the viral genome reverted to the wild type (WT) and compensatory mutations in NS3 gene appeared. Our results indicate that wMelPop impacts significantly the interactions of DENV2 with mosquito and mammalian host cells.IMPORTANCE Mosquito-borne diseases are of global significance causing considerable morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Dengue virus (DENV; serotypes 1 to 4), a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, causes millions of infections annually. Development of a safe vaccine is hampered due to absence of cross-protection and increased risk in secondary infections due to antibody-mediated immune enhancement. Infection of vector mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria offers a novel countermeasure to suppress DENV transmission, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, the host transcription profiles and viral RNA sequences were analyzed in naive A. albopictus (C6/36) and wMelPop-C6/36 cells by RNAseq. Our results showed that the wMelPop symbiont caused profound changes in host transcription profiles and morphology of DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. Accumulation of several mutations throughout DENV2 RNA resulted in loss of infectivity of progeny virions. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated suppression of DENV transmission. USA. paa9@georgetown.edu rp55@georgetown.edu.

16282468,2005 Dec,Invasion and maintenance of dengue virus type 2 and type 4 in the Americas.,"Dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) was first reported in the Americas in 1981, where it caused epidemics of dengue fever throughout the region. In the same year, the region's first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever was reported, caused by an Asian strain of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) that was distinct from the American subtype circulating previously. Despite the importance of these epidemics, little is known about the rates or determinants of viral spread among island and mainland populations or their directions of movement. We employed a Bayesian coalescent approach to investigate the transmission histories of DENV-2 and DENV-4 since their introduction in 1981 and a parsimony method to assess patterns of strain migration. For both viruses there was an initial invasion phase characterized by an exponential increase in the number of DENV lineages, after which levels of genetic diversity remained constant despite reported fluctuations in DENV-2 and DENV-4 activity. Strikingly, viral lineage numbers increased far more rapidly for DENV-4 than DENV-2, indicative of a more rapid rate of exponential population growth in DENV-4 or a higher rate of geographic dispersal, allowing this virus to move more effectively among localities. We propose that these contrasting dynamics may reflect underlying differences in patterns of host immunity. Despite continued gene flow along particular transmission routes, the overall extent of viral traffic was less than expected under panmixis. Hence, DENV in the Americas has a clear geographic structure that maintains viral diversity between outbreaks. the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad. ccarrington@fms.uwi.tt","['Americas/epidemiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Serotyping']","['Dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) was first reported in the Americas in 1981, where it caused epidemics of dengue fever throughout the region.', ""In the same year, the region's first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever was reported, caused by an Asian strain of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) that was distinct from the American subtype circulating previously."", 'Despite the importance of these epidemics, little is known about the rates or determinants of viral spread among island and mainland populations or their directions of movement.', 'We employed a Bayesian coalescent approach to investigate the transmission histories of DENV-2 and DENV-4 since their introduction in 1981 and a parsimony method to assess patterns of strain migration.', 'For both viruses there was an initial invasion phase characterized by an exponential increase in the number of DENV lineages, after which levels of genetic diversity remained constant despite reported fluctuations in DENV-2 and DENV-4 activity.', 'Strikingly, viral lineage numbers increased far more rapidly for DENV-4 than DENV-2, indicative of a more rapid rate of exponential population growth in DENV-4 or a higher rate of geographic dispersal, allowing this virus to move more effectively among localities.', 'We propose that these contrasting dynamics may reflect underlying differences in patterns of host immunity.', 'Despite continued gene flow along particular transmission routes, the overall extent of viral traffic was less than expected under panmixis.', 'Hence, DENV in the Americas has a clear geographic structure that maintains viral diversity between outbreaks.', 'the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad. ccarrington@fms.uwi.tt']"
23497045,2013 Mar 4,First isolation of dengue virus from Lao PDR in a Chinese traveler.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemic dengue activity has been demonstrated in several southern regions of China, but not in Yunnan province, which borders countries in Southeast Asia where dengue is endemic. Many dengue cases imported from Southeast Asia to Yunnan have been reported, but dengue virus (DENV) has not been isolated from any patients. This study is the first to report the isolation of DENV from a Chinese traveler returning to Yunnan from Lao PDR. FINDINGS: A serum sample was collected from a patient presenting with a febrile illness who returned from Lao PDR in 2009 and was used to inoculate Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells for viral isolation. The viral isolate was identified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and phylogenetic analyses based on the full E sequence were performed using Clustalx 1.8 software. The analyses detected DENV genome, and thus, a DENV isolate was obtained from the patient's serum sample. The new DENV isolate was grouped into genotype Asia 1, serotype 2. The viral E protein shared the greatest nucleotide sequence identity (99.6%) with the D2/Thailand/0606aTw strain isolated from Thailand in 2006 and demonstrated 94.3% to 100% identity with the predicted amino acid sequence of other DENV 2 strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that DENV serotype 2 is circulating in Lao PDR, and surveillance of patients suspected of infection with dengue should be conducted not only by a serological test but also by pathogenic detection methods.

24340118,2013,Dengue virus in sub-tropical northern and central Viet Nam: population immunity and climate shape patterns of viral invasion and maintenance.,"Dengue virus transmission occurs in both epidemic and endemic cycles across tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Incidence is particularly high in much of Southeast Asia, where hyperendemic transmission plagues both urban and rural populations. However, endemicity has not been established in some areas with climates that may not support year-round viral transmission. An understanding of how dengue viruses (DENV) enter these environments and whether the viruses persist in inapparent local transmission cycles is central to understanding how dengue emerges in areas at the margins of endemic transmission. Dengue is highly endemic in tropical southern Vietnam, while increasingly large seasonal epidemics have occurred in northern Viet Nam over the last decade. We have investigated the spread of DENV-1 throughout Vietnam to determine the routes by which the virus enters northern and central regions of the country. Phylogeographic analysis of 1,765 envelope (E) gene sequences from Southeast Asia revealed frequent movement of DENV between neighboring human populations and strong local clustering of viral lineages. Long-distance migration of DENV between human population centers also occurred regularly and on short time-scales, indicating human-mediated viral invasion into northern Vietnam. Human populations in southern Vietnam were found to be the primary source of DENV circulating throughout the country, while central and northern Vietnam acted as sink populations, likely due to reduced connectedness to other populations in the case of the central regions and to the influence of temperature variability on DENV replication and vector survival and competence in the north. Finally, phylogeographic analyses suggested that viral movement follows a gravity model and indicates that population immunity and physical and economic connections between populations may play important roles in shaping patterns of DENV transmission.

Until recently, such RNA-protein interactions have been identified predominantly with the use of in vitro assays that may not accurately reflect associations that occur in the context of a living cell. Here we describe a method for the specific affinity purification of dengue virus RNA and associated proteins using in vivo cross-linking followed by antisense-mediated affinity purification. RNA-binding proteins that specifically co-purify with viral RNA using this method can be identified en masse by mass spectrometry.

23951374,2013,"Molecular surveillance of dengue in Semarang, Indonesia revealed the circulation of an old genotype of dengue virus serotype-1.","Dengue disease is currently a major health problem in Indonesia and affects all provinces in the country, including Semarang Municipality, Central Java province. While dengue is endemic in this region, only limited data on the disease epidemiology is available. To understand the dynamics of dengue in Semarang, we conducted clinical, virological, and demographical surveillance of dengue in Semarang and its surrounding regions in 2012. Dengue cases were detected in both urban and rural areas located in various geographical features, including the coastal and highland areas. During an eight months' study, a total of 120 febrile patients were recruited, of which 66 were serologically confirmed for dengue infection using IgG/IgM ELISA and/or NS1 tests. The cases occurred both in dry and wet seasons. Majority of patients were under 10 years old. Most patients were diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever, followed by dengue shock syndrome and dengue fever. Serotyping was performed in 31 patients, and we observed the co-circulation of all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. When the serotypes were correlated with the severity of the disease, no direct correlation was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of DENV based on Envelope gene sequence revealed the circulation of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype and DENV-3 Genotype I. A striking finding was observed for DENV-1, in which we found the co-circulation of Genotype I with an old Genotype II. The Genotype II was represented by a virus strain that has a very slow mutation rate and is very closely related to the DENV strain from Thailand, isolated in 1964 and never reported in other countries in the last three decades. Moreover, this virus was discovered in a cool highland area with an elevation of 1,001 meters above the sea level. The discovery of this old DENV strain may suggest the silent circulation of old virus strains in Indonesia.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Serotyping', 'Young Adult']","['Dengue disease is currently a major health problem in Indonesia and affects all provinces in the country, including Semarang Municipality, Central Java province.', 'While dengue is endemic in this region, only limited data on the disease epidemiology is available.', 'To understand the dynamics of dengue in Semarang, we conducted clinical, virological, and demographical surveillance of dengue in Semarang and its surrounding regions in 2012.', 'Dengue cases were detected in both urban and rural areas located in various geographical features, including the coastal and highland areas.', ""During an eight months' study, a total of 120 febrile patients were recruited, of which 66 were serologically confirmed for dengue infection using IgG/IgM ELISA and/or NS1 tests."", 'The cases occurred both in dry and wet seasons.', 'Majority of patients were under 10 years old.', 'Most patients were diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever, followed by dengue shock syndrome and dengue fever.', 'Serotyping was performed in 31 patients, and we observed the co-circulation of all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes.', 'When the serotypes were correlated with the severity of the disease, no direct correlation was observed.', 'Phylogenetic analysis of DENV based on Envelope gene sequence revealed the circulation of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype and DENV-3 Genotype I.', 'A striking finding was observed for DENV-1, in which we found the co-circulation of Genotype I with an old Genotype II.', 'The Genotype II was represented by a virus strain that has a very slow mutation rate and is very closely related to the DENV strain from Thailand, isolated in 1964 and never reported in other countries in the last three decades.', 'Moreover, this virus was discovered in a cool highland area with an elevation of 1,001 meters above the sea level.', 'The discovery of this old DENV strain may suggest the silent circulation of old virus strains in Indonesia.']"
23431254,2013,Chloroquine inhibits dengue virus type 2 replication in Vero cells but not in C6/36 cells.,"Dengue viruses are the most important arthropod-borne viruses in terms of morbidity and mortality in the world. Since there is no dengue vaccine available for human use, we have set out to investigate the use of chloroquine as an antiviral drug against dengue. Chloroquine, an amine acidotropic drug known to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH, was used in the in vitro treatment of Vero and C6/36 cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). Real-time RT-PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV-2 load in infected Vero and C6/36 cells after chloroquine treatment. Our results showed that a dose of 50 μg/ml of chloroquine was not toxic to the cells and induced a statistically significant inhibition of virus production in infected Vero cells when compared to untreated cells. In C6/36 cells, chloroquine does not induce a statistically significant difference in viral replication when compared to untreated cells, showing that this virus uses an unlikely pathway of penetration in these cells, and results were also confirmed by the plaque assay (PFU). These data suggest that the inhibition of virus infection induced by chloroquine is due to interference with acidic vesicles in mammalian cells. of São Paulo, 14049-900 Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil. kfarias3@hotmail.com","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chloroquine/*pharmacology', 'Culicidae/cytology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vero Cells/virology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']","['Dengue viruses are the most important arthropod-borne viruses in terms of morbidity and mortality in the world.', 'Since there is no dengue vaccine available for human use, we have set out to investigate the use of chloroquine as an antiviral drug against dengue.', 'Chloroquine, an amine acidotropic drug known to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH, was used in the in vitro treatment of Vero and C6/36 cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2).', 'Real-time RT-PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV-2 load in infected Vero and C6/36 cells after chloroquine treatment.', 'Our results showed that a dose of 50 μg/ml of chloroquine was not toxic to the cells and induced a statistically significant inhibition of virus production in infected Vero cells when compared to untreated cells.', 'In C6/36 cells, chloroquine does not induce a statistically significant difference in viral replication when compared to untreated cells, showing that this virus uses an unlikely pathway of penetration in these cells, and results were also confirmed by the plaque assay (PFU).', 'These data suggest that the inhibition of virus infection induced by chloroquine is due to interference with acidic vesicles in mammalian cells.', 'of São Paulo, 14049-900 Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'kfarias3@hotmail.com']"

Virus readily replicated in Aal cells at either 30 or 37 C, but had no apparent effect on the host cell. Persistent infection was established with continual virus production for at least 6 months, although the virulence of progeny virus for both suckling mice and LLC-MK2 cells became attenuated.

The surface antigens of the virus produced in Aal cells appeared to be considerably modified in that antiserum to vertebrate cell-produced D-2 virus did not block hemagglutination, whereas anti-Aal cell antiserum did.

22096543,2011,Dengue reporter virus particles for measuring neutralizing antibodies against each of the four dengue serotypes.,"The lack of reliable, high-throughput tools for characterizing anti-dengue virus (DENV) antibodies in large numbers of serum samples has been an obstacle in understanding the impact of neutralizing antibodies on disease progression and vaccine efficacy. A reporter system using pseudoinfectious DENV reporter virus particles (RVPs) was previously developed by others to facilitate the genetic manipulation and biological characterization of DENV virions. In the current study, we demonstrate the diagnostic utility of DENV RVPs for measuring neutralizing antibodies in human serum samples against all four DENV serotypes, with attention to the suitability of DENV RVPs for large-scale, long-term studies. DENV RVPs used against human sera yielded serotype-specific responses and reproducible neutralization titers that were in statistical agreement with Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) results. DENV RVPs were also used to measure neutralization titers against the four DENV serotypes in a panel of human sera from a clinical study of dengue patients.

30340326,2018 Oct 18,Time to Harmonize Dengue Nomenclature and Classification.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is estimated to cause 390 million infections per year worldwide. A quarter of these infections manifest clinically and are associated with a morbidity and mortality that put a significant burden on the affected regions. Reports of increased frequency, intensity, and extended geographical range of outbreaks highlight the virus's ongoing global spread. Persistent transmission in endemic areas and the emergence in territories formerly devoid of transmission have shaped DENV's current genetic diversity and divergence. This genetic layout is hierarchically organized in serotypes, genotypes, and sub-genotypic clades. While serotypes are well defined, the genotype nomenclature and classification system lack consistency, which complicates a broader analysis of their clinical and epidemiological characteristics. We identify five key challenges: (1) Currently, there is no formal definition of a DENV genotype; (2) Two different nomenclature systems are used in parallel, which causes significant confusion; (3) A standardized classification procedure is lacking so far; (4) No formal definition of sub-genotypic clades is in place; (5) There is no consensus on how to report antigenic diversity. Therefore, we believe that the time is right to re-evaluate DENV genetic diversity in an essential effort to provide harmonization across DENV studies.

22226705,2012 Mar,Comparative evolutionary epidemiology of dengue virus serotypes.,"Evolutionary studies on dengue virus have frequently focused on intra-serotype diversity or on specific epidemics. In this study, we compiled a comprehensive data set of the envelope gene of dengue virus serotypes and conducted an extensive comparative study of evolutionary molecular epidemiology. We found that substitution rates are homogeneous among dengue serotypes, although their population dynamics have differed over the past few years as inferred by Bayesian coalescent methods. On a global scale, DENV-2 is the serotype with the highest effective population size. The genealogies also showed geographical structure within the serotypes. Finally, we also explored the causes of dengue virus serotype diversification by investigating the plausibility that it was driven by adaptive changes. Our results suggest that the envelope gene is under significant purifying selection and the hypothesis that dengue virus serotype diversification was the result of stochastic events cannot be ruled out. evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases","['Dengue/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetics, Population', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeography', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Serotyping', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']","['Evolutionary studies on dengue virus have frequently focused on intra-serotype diversity or on specific epidemics.', 'In this study, we compiled a comprehensive data set of the envelope gene of dengue virus serotypes and conducted an extensive comparative study of evolutionary molecular epidemiology.', 'We found that substitution rates are homogeneous among dengue serotypes, although their population dynamics have differed over the past few years as inferred by Bayesian coalescent methods.', 'On a global scale, DENV-2 is the serotype with the highest effective population size.', 'The genealogies also showed geographical structure within the serotypes.', 'Finally, we also explored the causes of dengue virus serotype diversification by investigating the plausibility that it was driven by adaptive changes.', 'Our results suggest that the envelope gene is under significant purifying selection and the hypothesis that dengue virus serotype diversification was the result of stochastic events cannot be ruled out.', 'evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases']"
22880140,2012,Refining the global spatial limits of dengue virus transmission by evidence-based consensus.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a growing problem both in its geographical spread and in its intensity, and yet current global distribution remains highly uncertain. Challenges in diagnosis and diagnostic methods as well as highly variable national health systems mean no single data source can reliably estimate the distribution of this disease. As such, there is a lack of agreement on national dengue status among international health organisations. Here we bring together all available information on dengue occurrence using a novel approach to produce an evidence consensus map of the disease range that highlights nations with an uncertain dengue status. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A baseline methodology was used to assess a range of evidence for each country. In regions where dengue status was uncertain, additional evidence types were included to either clarify dengue status or confirm that it is unknown at this time. An algorithm was developed that assesses evidence quality and consistency, giving each country an evidence consensus score. Using this approach, we were able to generate a contemporary global map of national-level dengue status that assigns a relative measure of certainty and identifies gaps in the available evidence. CONCLUSION: The map produced here provides a list of 128 countries for which there is good evidence of dengue occurrence, including 36 countries that have previously been classified as dengue-free by the World Health Organization and/or the US Centers for Disease Control. It also identifies disease surveillance needs, which we list in full. The disease extents and limits determined here using evidence consensus, marks the beginning of a five-year study to advance the mapping of dengue virus transmission and disease risk. Completion of this first step has allowed us to produce a preliminary estimate of population at risk with an upper bound of 3.97 billion people. This figure will be refined in future work.

We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that robustly predict dengue antigenic relationships.

34696384,2021 Sep 29,Morphological Aspects and Viremia Analysis of BALB/c Murine Model Experimentally Infected with Dengue Virus Serotype 4.,"Ever since its brief introduction in the Brazilian territory in 1981, dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4) remained absent from the national epidemiological scenario for almost 25 years. The emergence of DENV-4 in 2010 resulted in epidemics in most Brazilian states. DENV-4, however, remains one of the least studied among the four DENV serotypes. Despite being known as a mild serotype, DENV-4 is associated with severe cases and deaths and deserves to be investigated; however, the lack of suitable experimental animal models is a limiting factor for pathogenesis studies. Here, we aimed to investigate the susceptibility and potential tropism of DENV-4 for liver, lung and heart of an immunocompetent mice model, and to evaluate and investigate the resulting morphological and ultrastructural alterations upon viral infection. BALB/c mice were inoculated intravenously with non-neuroadapted doses of DENV-4 isolated from a human case. The histopathological analysis of liver revealed typical alterations of DENV, such as microsteatosis, edema and vascular congestion, while in lung, widespread areas of hemorrhage and interstitial pneumonia were observed. While milder alterations were present in heart, characterized by limited hemorrhage and discrete presence of inflammatory infiltrate, the disorganization of the structure of the intercalated disc is of particular interest.

23667626,2013,"Dengue virus type 3 adaptive changes during epidemics in São Jose de Rio Preto, Brazil, 2006-2007.","Global dengue virus spread in tropical and sub-tropical regions has become a major international public health concern. It is evident that DENV genetic diversity plays a significant role in the immunopathology of the disease and that the identification of polymorphisms associated with adaptive responses is important for vaccine development. The investigation of naturally occurring genomic variants may play an important role in the comprehension of different adaptive strategies used by these mutants to evade the human immune system. In order to elucidate this role we sequenced the complete polyprotein-coding region of thirty-three DENV-3 isolates to characterize variants circulating under high endemicity in the city of São José de Rio Preto, Brazil, during the onset of the 2006-07 epidemic. By inferring the evolutionary history on a local-scale and estimating rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonimous (dN) substitutions, we have documented at least two different introductions of DENV-3 into the city and detected 10 polymorphic codon sites under significant positive selection (dN/dS > 1) and 8 under significant purifying selection (dN/dS < 1). We found several polymorphic amino acid coding sites in the envelope (15), NS1 (17), NS2A (11), and NS5 (24) genes, which suggests that these genes may be experiencing relatively recent adaptive changes. Furthermore, some polymorphisms correlated with changes in the immunogenicity of several epitopes.

23342105,2013,Tracking the evolution of dengue virus strains D2S10 and D2S20 by 454 pyrosequencing.,"Dengue virus is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus worldwide. In this study, we used pyrosequencing to analyze the whole viral genome of two mouse-adapted strains, D2S10 and D2S20, that induce a dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS)-like lethal disease in mice lacking the type I and/or type II interferon receptors. Previous experiments with D2S10 indicated that N124D and K128E mutations in the envelope protein were responsible for the severe disease induced in mice compared to its parental strain PL046. Here we demonstrate that D2S20 is more virulent than D2S10 and captured the presence of five key amino acid mutations--T70I, N83D, and K122I in envelope (E), and A62T in nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) and G605V in nonstructural protein 5 (NS5)--that may account for this.

22970331,2012,Origin and evolution of dengue virus type 3 in Brazil.,"The incidence of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in Brazil experienced a significant increase since the emergence of dengue virus type-3 (DENV-3) at the early 2000s. Despite the major public health concerns, there have been very few studies of the molecular epidemiology and time-scale of this DENV lineage in Brazil. In this study, we investigated the origin and dispersion dynamics of DENV-3 genotype III in Brazil by examining a large number (n=107) of E gene sequences sampled between 2001 and 2009 from diverse Brazilian regions. These Brazilian sequences were combined with 457 DENV-3 genotype III E gene sequences from 29 countries around the world. Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that there have been at least four introductions of the DENV-3 genotype III in Brazil, as signified by the presence of four phylogenetically distinct lineages. Three lineages (BR-I, BR-II, and BR-III) were probably imported from the Lesser Antilles (Caribbean), while the fourth one (BR-IV) was probably introduced from Colombia or Venezuela. While lineages BR-I and BR-II succeeded in getting established and disseminated in Brazil and other countries from the Southern Cone, lineages BR-III and BR-IV were only detected in one single individual each from the North region. The phylogeographic analysis indicates that DENV-3 lineages BR-I and BR-II were most likely introduced into Brazil through the Southeast and North regions around 1999 (95% HPD: 1998-2000) and 2001 (95% HPD: 2000-2002), respectively. These findings show that importation of DENV-3 lineages from the Caribbean islands into Brazil seems to be relatively frequent. Our study further suggests that the North and Southeast Brazilian regions were the most important hubs of introduction and spread of DENV-3 lineages and deserve an intense epidemiological surveillance.

24192777,2014 Jan,Single-virus tracking approach to reveal the interaction of Dengue virus with autophagy during the early stage of infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the major infectious pathogens worldwide. DENV infection is a highly dynamic process. Currently, no antiviral drug is available for treating DENV-induced diseases since little is known regarding how the virus interacts with host cells during infection. Advanced molecular imaging technologies are powerful tools to understand the dynamics of intracellular interactions and molecular trafficking. This study exploited a single-virus particle tracking technology to address whether DENV interacts with autophagy machinery during the early stage of infection. Using confocal microscopy and three-dimensional image analysis, we showed that DENV triggered the formation of green fluorescence protein-fused microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) puncta, and DENV-induced autophagosomes engulfed DENV particles within 15-min postinfection. Moreover, single-virus particle tracking revealed that both DENV particles and autophagosomes traveled together during the viral infection. Finally, in the presence of autophagy suppressor 3-methyladenine, the replication of DENV was inhibited and the location of DENV particles spread in cytoplasma. In contrast, the numbers of newly synthesized DENV were elevated and the co-localization of DENV particles and autophagosomes was detected while the cells were treated with autophagy inducer rapamycin. Taken together, we propose that DENV particles interact with autophagosomes at the early stage of viral infection, which promotes the replication of DENV.

29699483,2018 Apr 24,Emergence of the Asian lineage dengue virus type 3 genotype III in Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus type 3 genotype III (DENV3/III) is associated with increased number of severe infections when it emerged in the Americas and Asia. We had previously demonstrated that the DENV3/III was introduced into Malaysia in the late 2000s. We investigated the genetic diversity of DENV3/III strains recovered from Malaysia and examined their phylogenetic relationships against other DENV3/III strains isolated globally. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed at least four distinct DENV3/III lineages. Two of the lineages (DENV3/III-B and DENV3/III-C) are current actively circulating whereas the DENV3/III-A and DENV3/III-D were no longer recovered since the 1980s. Selection pressure analysis revealed strong evidence of positive selection on a number of amino acid sites in PrM, E, NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, and NS5. The Malaysian DENV3/III isolates recovered in the 1980s (MY.59538/1987) clustered into DENV3/III-B, which was the lineage with cosmopolitan distribution consisting of strains actively circulating in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The Malaysian isolates recovered after the 2000s clustered within DENV3/III-C. This DENV3/III-C lineage displayed a more restricted geographical distribution and consisted of isolates recovered from Asia, denoted as the Asian lineage. Amino acid variation sites in NS5 (NS5-553I/M, NS5-629 T, and NS5-820E) differentiated the DENV3/III-C from other DENV3 viruses. The codon 629 of NS5 was identified as a positively selected site. While the NS5-698R was identified as unique to the genome of DENV3/III-C3. Phylogeographic results suggested that the recent Malaysian DENV3/III-C was likely to have been introduced from Singapore in 2008 and became endemic. From Malaysia, the virus subsequently spread into Taiwan and Thailand in the early part of the 2010s and later reintroduced into Singapore in 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct clustering of the Malaysian old and new DENV3/III isolates suggests that the currently circulating DENV3/III in Malaysia did not descend directly from the strains recovered during the 1980s. Phylogenetic analyses and common genetic traits in the genome of the strains and those from the neighboring countries suggest that the Malaysian DENV3/III is likely to have been introduced from the neighboring regions.

17337028,2007 Jul 5,Interference in dengue virus adsorption and uncoating by carrageenans.,"This study demonstrated that the lambda- and iota-carrageenans, sulfated polysaccharides containing linear chains of galactopyranosyl residues, are potent inhibitors of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) and 3 (DENV-3) multiplication in Vero and HepG2 cells, with values of effective concentration 50% from 0.14 to 4.1 microg/ml. This activity was assayed by plaque reduction, virus yield inhibition and antigen expression tests, and was independent of the input multiplicity of infection in the range 0.001-1. The inhibitory action of the lambda-carrageenan, an heparan sulfate (HS)-imitative compound, was exerted by a dual interference with virus adsorption and internalization of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Although virus particles may enter the cell when compound was added after DENV-2 adsorption, as shown by intracellular uptake of radiolabeled DENV-2 particles and quantitative RT-PCR, infectious center and virion uncoating assays have shown that carrageenan-treated virions cannot be released from the endosomes. Viral protein synthesis, the first step of macromolecular synthesis after DENV entry to the host cell, was not affected by the carrageenan.

26328895,2015 Sep 2,Delayed antibody dependent enhancement of low passage dengue virus 4 isolates.,"BACKGROUND: The concept of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection is a cornerstone of our current understanding of dengue pathogenesis, although some questions as to the mechanism remain, particularly in regards to the behavior of low and high passage virus isolates. This study utilized two low passage DENV 4 isolates and a laboratory adapted DENV 4 isolate to investigate the potential of low passage isolates to undergo ADE. RESULTS: Little or no ADE of infection was observed on day 2 post infection with low passage isolates, while high enhancement of infection was seen with the laboratory adapted virus. However, both of the low passage isolates showed high levels of infection (60-100%) by day 5 post infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that low passage DENV 4 viruses undergo ADE mediated infection, but that the process is significantly temporally delayed as compared to laboratory adapted DENV 4.

We previously reported that attenuation markers of DEN-2 PDK-53 virus were encoded by genetic loci located outside the structural gene region of the PDK-53 virus genome. Chimeric viruses containing the nonstructural genes of DEN-2 PDK-53 virus and the structural genes of the parental DEN-1 16007 virus retained the attenuation markers of small plaque size and temperature sensitivity in LLC-MK(2) cells, less efficient replication in C6/36 cells, and attenuation for mice. These chimeric viruses elicited higher mouse neutralizing antibody titers against DEN-1 virus than did the candidate DEN-1 PDK-13 vaccine virus or chimeric DEN-2/DEN-1 viruses containing the structural genes of the PDK-13 virus. Mutations in the envelope protein of DEN-1 PDK-13 virus affected in vitro phenotype and immunogenicity in mice. The current PDK-13 vaccine is the least efficient of the four Mahidol candidate DEN virus vaccines in human trials. The chimeric DEN-2/DEN-1 virus might be a potential DEN-1 virus vaccine candidate.

15507651,2004 Nov,Serotype-specific entry of dengue virus into liver cells: identification of the 37-kilodalton/67-kilodalton high-affinity laminin receptor as a dengue virus serotype 1 receptor.,"Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever, dengue shock syndrome, and dengue hemorrhagic fever, infects susceptible cells by initially binding to a receptor(s) located on the host cell surface. Evidence to date suggests that receptor usage may be cell and serotype specific, and this study sought to identify dengue virus serotype 1 binding proteins on the surface of liver cells, a known target organ. By using a virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), in both nondenaturing and denaturing gel systems, a putative dengue virus serotype 1 binding protein of approximately 37 kDa expressed on the surface of liver (HepG2) cells was identified. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a candidate protein, the 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor. Entry of the dengue virus serotype 1 was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both antibodies directed against the 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor and soluble laminin. No inhibition of virus entry was seen with dengue virus serotypes 2, 3, or 4, demonstrating that the 37/67-kDa high-affinity laminin receptor is a serotype-specific receptor for dengue virus entry into liver cells.

24829280,2014 Jul 6,Within-host viral dynamics of dengue serotype 1 infection.,"Dengue, the most common mosquito-borne viral infection of humans, is endemic across much of the world, including much of tropical Asia and is increasing in its geographical range. Here, we present a mathematical model of dengue virus dynamics within infected individuals, detailing the interaction between virus and a simple immune response. We fit this model to measurements of plasma viral titre from cases of primary and secondary DENV 1 infection in Vietnam. We show that variation in model parameters governing the immune response is sufficient to create the observed variation in virus dynamics between individuals. Estimating model parameter values, we find parameter differences between primary and secondary cases consistent with the theory of antibody-dependent enhancement (namely enhanced rates of viral entry to target cells in secondary cases). Finally, we use our model to examine the potential impact of an antiviral drug on the within-host dynamics of dengue. We conclude that the impact of antiviral therapy on virus dynamics is likely to be limited if therapy is only started at the onset of symptoms, owing to the typically late stage of viral pathogenesis reached by the time symptoms are manifested and thus treatment is started. and Modelling, Imperial College, London W2 1PG, UK hannah.clapham08@imperial.ac.uk.

21293097,2011,Statins reduce dengue virus production via decreased virion assembly.,"BACKGROUND: Most of the effects of statins can be explained by pleiotropic effects independent of their lowering of serum cholesterol; in some cases, these effects have been shown to be a result of the role of statins in the prenylation of cellular proteins, some of which are involved in the life cycle of animal viruses. This study evaluated the potential antiviral activity of lovastatin (LOV) against dengue virus (DENV) infection of epithelial and endothelial cells (VERO cells, epithelial cells derived from African green monkey kidney, and HMEC-1 cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells). METHODS: To evaluate its potential antiviral effects, LOV was used before, during and after inoculation of cell cultures with DENV. RESULTS: Before and after viral inoculation, LOV caused a reduction in virus yield (80% for HMECs and 25% for VERO cells). However, with LOV treatment after inoculation induced a marked increase (2- to 9-fold) in viral-positive RNA while the amount of viral protein increased only by 13-23%. A moderate reduction (1 log unit) in viral titer occurred concurrent with the increase in DENV genomic RNA and protein within the cells.

26327586,2015,Analysis of Dengue Virus Genetic Diversity during Human and Mosquito Infection Reveals Genetic Constraints.,"Dengue viruses (DENV) cause debilitating and potentially life-threatening acute disease throughout the tropical world. While drug development efforts are underway, there are concerns that resistant strains will emerge rapidly. Indeed, antiviral drugs that target even conserved regions in other RNA viruses lose efficacy over time as the virus mutates. Here, we sought to determine if there are regions in the DENV genome that are not only evolutionarily conserved but genetically constrained in their ability to mutate and could hence serve as better antiviral targets. High-throughput sequencing of DENV-1 genome directly from twelve, paired dengue patients' sera and then passaging these sera into the two primary mosquito vectors showed consistent and distinct sequence changes during infection. In particular, two residues in the NS5 protein coding sequence appear to be specifically acquired during infection in Ae. aegypti but not Ae. albopictus. Importantly, we identified a region within the NS3 protein coding sequence that is refractory to mutation during human and mosquito infection. Collectively, these findings provide fresh insights into antiviral targets and could serve as an approach to defining evolutionarily constrained regions for therapeutic targeting in other RNA viruses.

23617898,2013 Apr 23,Development of a transmission model for dengue virus.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) research has historically been hampered by the lack of a susceptible vertebrate transmission model. Recently, there has been progress towards such models using several varieties of knockout mice, particularly those deficient in type I and II interferon receptors. Based on the critical nature of the type I interferon response in limiting DENV infection establishment, we assessed the permissiveness of a mouse strain with a blunted type I interferon response via gene deficiencies in interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3/7 -/- -/-) with regards to DENV transmission success. We investigated the possibility of transmission to the mouse by needle and infectious mosquito, and subsequent transmission back to mosquito from an infected animal during its viremic period. METHODS: Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with non-mouse adapted DENV-2 strain 1232 and serum was tested for viral load and cytokine production each day. Additionally, mosquitoes were orally challenged with the same DENV-2 strain via artificial membrane feeder, and then allowed to forage or naïve mice. Subsequently, we determined acquisition potential by allowing naïve mosquitoes on forage on exposed mice during their viremic period. RESULTS: Both needle inoculation and infectious mosquito bite(s) resulted in 100% infection. Significant differences between these groups in viremia on the two days leading to peak viremia were observed, though no significant difference in cytokine production was seen. Through our determination of transmission and acquisition potentials, the transmission cycle (mouse-to mosquito-to mouse) was completed. We confirmed that the IRF3/7 -/- -/- mouse supports DENV replication and is competent for transmission experiments, with the ability to use a non-mouse adapted DENV-2 strain. A significant finding of this study was that this IRF3/7 -/- -/- mouse strain was able to be infected by and transmit virus to mosquitoes, thus providing means to replicate the natural transmission cycle of DENV.

28482813,2017 May 8,"Epidemiological and molecular characteristics of emergent dengue virus in Yunnan Province near the China-Myanmar-Laos border, 2013-2015.","BACKGROUND: Yunnan Province is located in southwestern China and neighbors the Southeast Asian countries, all of which are dengue-endemic areas. In 2000-2013, sporadic imported cases of dengue fever (DF) were reported almost annually in Yunnan Province. During 2013-2015, we confirmed that a large-scale indigenous DF outbreak emerged in cities of Yunnan Province near the China-Myanmar-Laos border. METHODS: Epidemiological characteristics of DF in Yunnan Province during 2013-2015 were evaluated by retrospective analysis. A total of 232 dengue virus (DENV)-positive sera were randomly collected for sequence analysis of the capsid/premembrane region of DENV from patients with DF in Yunnan Province. The envelope gene of DENV isolates was also amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method with the Tajima-Nei model. RESULTS: Phylogenetically, all DENV-positive samples could be classified into DENV-1 genotype I and DENV-2 Asian I genotype during 2013-2015 and DENV-4 genotype I in 2015 from Ruili City; and DENV-3 genotype II in 2013 and DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype in 2015 from Xishuangbanna Prefecture. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that imported DF from patients from Laos and Myanmar was the primary cause of the DF epidemic in Yunnan Province. Additionally, DENV strains of all four serotypes were identified in indigenous cases in Yunnan Province during the same time period, while the dengue epidemic pattern observed in southwestern Yunnan showed characteristics of a hypoendemic nature: circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 over consecutive years.

Dengue in Delhi from being epidemic is slowly changing towards being endemic and hyper-endemic. Circulating type of the virus is also changing over the years. In the absence of an effective vaccine, dengue prevention to a major extent relies on virological surveillance, and development of effective, locally adapted control programmes. In the present study, we tried to identify the between-year non-epidemic serotype of dengue virus circulating in Delhi, during 2010-11. METHODS: Acute-phase samples were collected from the patients attending the Institute of Liver & Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India. Dengue diagnosis was done using WHO case definitions. All the samples were subjected to Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA and modified nested RT-PCR. RESULTS: A total of 75 acute-phase samples were received, of which 19 (25.3%) were positive for dengue NS1 antigen. Dengue RT-PCR was positive in 14.6% (11/75) samples. All the RT-PCR isolates were of DENV-1 serotype. No case of concomitant infection with more than one serotype was observed. Median age of involvement was 23 yr (range10-86). Maximum number of cases were seen in the age group of 21-30 yr. Male to female ratio was 1.2 : 1. Maximum number of suspected dengue cases (n=79) was seen during September and October. CONCLUSIONS: DENV-1 was circulating in Delhi in the year 2010-11 in non-epidemic period following reported predominance of DENV-3 and co-circulation of all dengue serotypes in the epidemic years 2003, 2006 and 2007.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Child', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serotyping', 'Young Adult']","['BACKGROUND: Delhi, a city in north India, has so far witnessed several reported outbreaks of dengue.', 'Dengue in Delhi from being epidemic is slowly changing towards being endemic and hyper-endemic.', 'Circulating type of the virus is also changing over the years.', 'In the absence of an effective vaccine, dengue prevention to a major extent relies on virological surveillance, and development of effective, locally adapted control programmes.', 'In the present study, we tried to identify the between-year non-epidemic serotype of dengue virus circulating in Delhi, during 2010-11.', 'METHODS: Acute-phase samples were collected from the patients attending the Institute of Liver & Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Dengue diagnosis was done using WHO case definitions.', 'All the samples were subjected to Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA and modified nested RT-PCR.', 'RESULTS: A total of 75 acute-phase samples were received, of which 19 (25.3%) were positive for dengue NS1 antigen.', 'Dengue RT-PCR was positive in 14.6% (11/75) samples.', 'All the RT-PCR isolates were of DENV-1 serotype.', 'No case of concomitant infection with more than one serotype was observed.', 'Median age of involvement was 23 yr (range10-86).', 'Maximum number of cases were seen in the age group of 21-30 yr.', 'Male to female ratio was 1.2 : 1.', 'Maximum number of suspected dengue cases (n=79) was seen during September and October.', 'CONCLUSIONS: DENV-1 was circulating in Delhi in the year 2010-11 in non-epidemic period following reported predominance of DENV-3 and co-circulation of all dengue serotypes in the epidemic years 2003, 2006 and 2007.']"
27030492,2016 Jun,A Pan-Dengue Virus Reverse Transcription-Insulated Isothermal PCR Assay Intended for Point-of-Need Diagnosis of Dengue Virus Infection by Use of the POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is considered a major public health problem in developing tropical countries where the virus is endemic and continues to cause major disease outbreaks every year. Here, we describe the development of a novel, inexpensive, and user-friendly diagnostic assay based on a reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) method for the detection of all four serotypes of DENV in clinical samples. The diagnostic performance of the newly established pan-DENV RT-iiPCR assay targeting a conserved 3' untranslated region of the viral genome was evaluated. The limit of detection with a 95% confidence was estimated to be 10 copies of in vitro-transcribed (IVT) RNA. Sensitivity analysis using RNA prepared from 10-fold serial dilutions of tissue culture fluid containing DENVs suggested that the RT-iiPCR assay was comparable to the multiplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay for DENV-1, -3, and -4 detection but 10-fold less sensitive for DENV-2 detection. Subsequently, plasma collected from patients suspected of dengue virus infection (n = 220) and individuals not suspected of dengue virus infection (n = 45) were tested by the RT-iiPCR and compared to original test results using a DENV NS1 antigen rapid test and the qRT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR, NS1 antigen rapid test, and qRT-PCR tests was 93.9%, 84.5%, and 97.4%, respectively, compared to the composite reference results. This new RT-iiPCR assay along with the portable POCKIT nucleic acid analyzer could provide a highly reliable, sensitive, and specific point-of-need diagnostic assay for the diagnosis of DENV in clinics and hospitals in developing countries.

Clones of dengue virus type 2 obtained by plaque selection in primary green monkey kidney cell cultures were tested for temperature sensitivity in vitro and for virulence by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice. Sublines of a small-plaque clone were found to have lower nonpermissive temperatures than the parent virus by both plaque formation and release of infectious virus into the culture media. Small-plaque sublines were significantly less virulent in suckling mice than was the parent virus. Sublines from a large-plaque clone were not temperature sensitive and closely resembled parent virus mixed-plaque morphology. When small-plaque sublines were serially passaged using undiluted inocula, reversion occurred as evidenced by the appearance of large plaques and return of mouse virulence. Small-plaque virus could be maintained through several serial passages without reversion by using low-input inocula. Desirable passage history as well as temperature-sensitive and attentuation characteristics of the S-1 small-plaque subline make it appear suitable as a vaccine candidate virus.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Genetics, Microbial', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Temperature', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Viral Vaccines/*isolation & purification', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication']","['Dengue virus, type 2, in viremic human sera and after passage in cell cultures produces mixtures of small and large plaques when assayed in LLC-MK2 cells.', 'Clones of dengue virus type 2 obtained by plaque selection in primary green monkey kidney cell cultures were tested for temperature sensitivity in vitro and for virulence by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice.', 'Sublines of a small-plaque clone were found to have lower nonpermissive temperatures than the parent virus by both plaque formation and release of infectious virus into the culture media.', 'Small-plaque sublines were significantly less virulent in suckling mice than was the parent virus.', 'Sublines from a large-plaque clone were not temperature sensitive and closely resembled parent virus mixed-plaque morphology.', 'When small-plaque sublines were serially passaged using undiluted inocula, reversion occurred as evidenced by the appearance of large plaques and return of mouse virulence.', 'Small-plaque virus could be maintained through several serial passages without reversion by using low-input inocula.', 'Desirable passage history as well as temperature-sensitive and attentuation characteristics of the S-1 small-plaque subline make it appear suitable as a vaccine candidate virus.']"
29123142,2017 Nov 9,Genomic and epidemiological characterisation of a dengue virus outbreak among blood donors in Brazil.,"Outbreaks caused by Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses can spread rapidly in immunologically naïve populations. By analysing 92 newly generated viral genome sequences from blood donors and recipients, we assess the dynamics of dengue virus serotype 4 during the 2012 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the outbreak was caused by genotype II, although two isolates of genotype I were also detected for the first time in Rio de Janeiro. Evolutionary analysis and modelling estimates are congruent, indicating a reproduction number above 1 between January and June, and at least two thirds of infections being unnoticed. Modelling analysis suggests that viral transmission started in early January, which is consistent with multiple introductions, most likely from the northern states of Brazil, and with an increase in within-country air travel to Rio de Janeiro.

No effective DENV vaccine is available, and the current treatment is only supportive. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic agents to cure this epidemic disease. In the present study, we identified a potential small-molecule inhibitor, BP13944, via high-throughput screening (HTS) of 60,000 compounds using a stable cell line harboring an efficient luciferase replicon of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2). BP13944 reduced the expression of the DENV replicon reporter in cells, showing a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 1.03 ± 0.09 μM. Without detectable cytotoxicity, the compound inhibited replication or viral RNA synthesis in all four serotypes of DENV but not in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Sequencing analyses of several individual clones derived from BP13944-resistant RNAs purified from cells harboring the DENV-2 replicon revealed a consensus amino acid substitution (E66G) in the region of the NS3 protease domain. Introduction of E66G into the DENV replicon, an infectious DENV cDNA clone, and recombinant NS2B/NS3 protease constructs conferred 15.2-, 17.2-, and 3.1-fold resistance to BP13944, respectively.

24155405,2014 Jan,Near-atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopic structure of dengue serotype 4 virus.,"Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne virus, is responsible for millions of cases of infections worldwide. There are four DENV serotypes (DENV1 to -4). After a primary DENV infection, the antibodies elicited confer lifetime protection against that DENV serotype. However, in a secondary infection with another serotype, the preexisting antibodies may cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection of macrophage cells, leading to the development of the more severe form of disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever. Thus, a safe vaccine should stimulate protection against all dengue serotypes simultaneously. To facilitate the development of a vaccine, good knowledge of different DENV serotype structures is crucial. Structures of DENV1 and DENV2 had been solved previously. Here we present a near-atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of mature DENV4.

15795296,2005 Apr,Inhibition of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 in vero cell cultures with morpholino oligomers.,"Five dengue (DEN) virus-specific R5F2R4 peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P4-PMOs) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit replication of DEN virus serotype 2 (DEN-2 virus) in mammalian cell culture. Initial growth curves of DEN-2 virus 16681 were obtained in Vero cells incubated with 20 microM P4-PMO compounds. At 6 days after infection, a P4-PMO targeting the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the DEN-2 virus genome and a random-sequence P4-PMO showed relatively little suppression of DEN-2 virus titer (0.1 and 0.9 log10, respectively). P4-PMOs targeting the AUG translation start site region of the single open reading frame and the 5' cyclization sequence region had moderate activity, generating 1.6- and 1.8-log10 reductions. Two P4-PMO compounds, 5'SL and 3'CS (targeting the 5'-terminal nucleotides and the 3' cyclization sequence region, respectively), were highly efficacious, each reducing the viral titer by greater than 5.7 log10 compared to controls at 6 days after infection with DEN-2 virus. Further experiments showed that 5'SL and 3'CS inhibited DEN-2 virus replication in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. Treatment with 10 microM 3'CS reduced the titers of all four DEN virus serotypes, i.e., DEN-1 (strain 16007), DEN-2 (16681), DEN-3 (16562), and DEN-4 (1036) viruses by over 4 log10, in most cases to below detectable limits. The extent of 3'CS efficacy was affected by the timing of compound application in relation to viral infection of the cells. The 5'SL and 3'CS P4-PMOs did not suppress the replication of West Nile virus NY99 in Vero cells. These data indicate that further evaluation of the 5'SL and 3'CS compounds as potential DEN virus therapeutics is warranted.

14993605,2004 Mar 9,Solution structure of dengue virus capsid protein reveals another fold.,"Dengue virus is responsible for approximately 50-100 million infections, resulting in nearly 24,000 deaths annually. The capsid (C) protein of dengue virus is essential for specific encapsidation of the RNA genome, but little structural information on the C protein is available. We report the solution structure of the 200-residue homodimer of dengue 2 C protein. The structure provides, to our knowledge, the first 3D picture of a flavivirus C protein and identifies a fold that includes a large dimerization surface contributed by two pairs of helices, one of which has characteristics of a coiled-coil. NMR structure determination involved a secondary structure sorting approach to facilitate assignment of the intersubunit nuclear Overhauser effect interactions. The dimer of dengue C protein has an unusually high net charge, and the structure reveals an asymmetric distribution of basic residues over the surface of the protein. Nearly half of the basic residues lie along one face of the dimer. In contrast, the conserved hydrophobic region forms an extensive apolar surface at a dimer interface on the opposite side of the molecule. We propose a model for the interaction of dengue C protein with RNA and the viral membrane that is based on the asymmetric charge distribution of the protein and is consistent with previously reported results.

27903277,2016 Nov 30,Sequence diversity of dengue virus type 2 in brain and thymus of infected interferon receptor ko mice: implications for dengue virulence.,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that a clinical isolate of dengue virus (DENV) is capable of causing acute-phase systemic infection in mice harboring knockouts of the genes encoding type-I and -II interferon IFN receptors (IFN-α/β/γR KO mice); in contrast, other virulent DENV isolates exhibited slow disease progression in this mice, yielding lethal infection around 20 days post-infection (p.i.). In the present study, we sought to clarify the dynamics of slow disease progression by examining disease progression of a type-2 DENV clinical isolate (DV2P04/08) in mice. METHODS: The tissue distributions of DV2P04/08 in several organs of infeted mice were examined at different time points. Whole genome viral sequences from organs were determined. RESULTS: At day 6 p.i., high levels of viral RNA (vRNA) were detected in non-neuronal organs (including peritoneal exudate cells (PECs), spleen, kidney, liver, lung, and bone marrow) but not in brain. By day 14 p.i, vRNA levels subsequently decreased in most organs, with the exception of thymus and brain. Sequence analysis of the whole genome of the original P04/08 and those of viruses recovered from mouse brain and thymus demonstrated the presence of both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. Individual mice showed different virus populations in the brain. The vRNA sequence derived from brain of one mouse was nearly identical to the original DV2P04/08 inoculum, suggesting that there was no need for adaptation of DV2P04/08 for growth in the brain. However, quasispecies (that is, mixed populations, detected as apparent nucleotide mixtures during sequencing) were observed in the thymus of another mouse, and interestingly only mutant population invaded the brain at a late stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the mouse nearly succeeded in eliminating virus from non-neuronal organs but failed to do so from brain. Although the cause of death by DV2P04/08 infection is likely to be the result of virus invasion to brain, its processes to the death are different in individual mice.

31134586,2019 Oct,Proteomics Profiling of Host Cell Response via Protein Expression and Phosphorylation upon Dengue Virus Infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a worldwide public health threat. To date, the knowledge about the pathogenesis and progression of DENV infection is still limited. Combining global profiling based on proteomic analysis together with functional verification analysis is a powerful strategy to investigate the interplay between the virus and host cells. In the present study, quantitative proteomics has been applied to evaluate host responses (as indicated by altered proteins and modifications) in human cells (using K562 cell line) upon DENV-2 infection, as DENV-2 spreads most widely among all DENV serotypes. Comparative analysis was performed to define differentially expressed proteins in the infected cells compared to the mock-control, and it revealed critical pathogen-induced changes covering a broad spectrum of host cellular compartments and processes. We also discovered more dramatic changes (> 20%, 160 regulated phosphoproteins) in protein phosphorylation compared to protein expression (14%, 321 regulated proteins). Most of these proteins/phosphoproteins were involved in transcription regulation, RNA splicing and processing, immune system, cellular response to stimulus, and macromolecule biosynthesis. Western blot analysis was also performed to confirm the proteomic data. Potential roles of these altered proteins were discussed. The present study provides valuable large-scale protein-related information for elucidating the functional emphasis of host cell proteins and their post-translational modifications in virus infection, and also provides insight and protein evidence for understanding the general pathogenesis and pathology of DENV.

18350148,2008 Mar 19,High genetic stability of dengue virus propagated in MRC-5 cells as compared to the virus propagated in vero cells.,"This work investigated the replication kinetics of the four dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1 to DEN-4), including dengue virus type 4 (DEN-4) recovered from an infectious cDNA clone, in Vero cells and in MRC-5 cells grown on Cytodex 1 microcarriers. DEN-1 strain Hawaii, DEN-2 strain NGC, DEN-3 strain H-87, and DEN-4 strain H-241 , and DEN-4 strain 814669 derived from cloned DNA, were used to infect Vero cells and MRC-5 cells grown in serum-free or serum-containing microcarrier cultures. Serum-free and serum-containing cultures were found to yield comparable titers of these viruses. The cloned DNA-derived DEN-4 started genetically more homogeneous was used to investigate the genetic stability of the virus propagated in Vero cells and MRC-5 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the DEN-4 propagated in MRC-5 cells maintained a high genetic stability, compared to the virus propagated in Vero cells. Amino acid substitutions of Gly(104)Cys and Phe(108)Ile were detected at 70%, 60%, respectively, in the envelope (E) protein of DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells, whereas a single mutation of Glu(345)Lys was detected at 50% in E of the virus propagated in MRC-5 cells. Sequencing of multiple clones of three separate DNA fragments spanning 40% of the genome also indicated that DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells contained a higher number of mutations than the virus growing in MRC-5 cells. Although Vero cells yielded a peak virus titer approximately 1 to 17 folds higher than MRC-5 cells, cloned DEN-4 from MRC-5 cells maintained a greater stability than the virus from Vero cells.

23741001,2013 Aug,Role of RNA interference (RNAi) in dengue virus replication and identification of NS4B as an RNAi suppressor.,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an important antiviral defense response in plants and invertebrates; however, evidences for its contribution to mammalian antiviral defense are few. In the present study, we demonstrate the anti-dengue virus role of RNAi in mammalian cells. Dengue virus infection of Huh 7 cells decreased the mRNA levels of host RNAi factors, namely, Dicer, Drosha, Ago1, and Ago2, and in corollary, silencing of these genes in virus-infected cells enhanced dengue virus replication. In addition, we observed downregulation of many known human microRNAs (miRNAs) in response to viral infection. Using reversion-of-silencing assays, we further showed that NS4B of all four dengue virus serotypes is a potent RNAi suppressor. We generated a series of deletion mutants and demonstrated that NS4B mediates RNAi suppression via its middle and C-terminal domains, namely, transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) and TMD5. Importantly, the NS4B N-terminal region, including the signal sequence 2K, which has been implicated in interferon (IFN)-antagonistic properties, was not involved in mediating RNAi suppressor activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues revealed that a Phe-to-Ala (F112A) mutation in the TMD3 region resulted in a significant reduction of the RNAi suppression activity. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis of the GFP-silenced line was considerably reduced by wild-type NS4B, while the F112A mutant abrogated this reduction. These results were further confirmed by in vitro dicer assays. Together, our results suggest the involvement of miRNA/RNAi pathways in dengue virus establishment and that dengue virus NS4B protein plays an important role in the modulation of the host RNAi/miRNA pathway to favor dengue virus replication.

17196419,2007 Jan,The envelope glycoprotein domain III of dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 inhibit virus entry.,"Dengue virus (DV) is a flavivirus and its urban transmission is maintained largely by its mosquito vectors and vertebrate host, often human. In this study, investigation was carried out on the involvement of domain III of the envelope (E) glycosylated protein of dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 (DV-1 and DV-2 DIII) in binding to host cell surfaces, thus mediating virus entry. Domain III protein of flavivirus can also serve as an attractive target in inhibiting virus entry. The respective DV DIII proteins were expressed as soluble recombinant fusion proteins before purification through enzymatic cleavage and affinity purification. The purified recombinant DV-1 and DV-2 DIII proteins both demonstrated the ability to inhibit the entry of DV-1 and DV-2 into HepG2 cells and C6/36 mosquito cells. As such, the DV DIII protein is indeed important for the interaction with cellular receptors in both human and mosquito cells. In addition, this protein induced antibodies that completely neutralized homologous dengue serotypes although not with the same efficiency among the heterologous serotypes. This observation may be of importance when formulating a generic vaccine that is effective against all dengue virus serotypes.

26197333,2015 Jul 21,Amino Terminal Region of Dengue Virus NS4A Cytosolic Domain Binds to Highly Curved Liposomes.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen causing millions of disease cases and thousands of deaths worldwide. Non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) is a vital component of the viral replication complex (RC) and plays a major role in the formation of host cell membrane-derived structures that provide a scaffold for replication. The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of NS4A(1-48) is known to preferentially interact with highly curved membranes. Here, we provide experimental evidence for the stable binding of NS4A(1-48) to small liposomes using a liposome floatation assay and identify the lipid binding sequence by NMR spectroscopy. Mutations L6E;M10E were previously shown to inhibit DENV replication and to interfere with the binding of NS4A(1-48) to small liposomes.

23035113,2012 Nov 23,The stem region of premembrane protein plays an important role in the virus surface protein rearrangement during dengue maturation.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus surface proteins, envelope (E) and pre-membrane (prM), undergo rearrangement during the maturation process at acidic condition. RESULTS: prM-stem region binds tighter to both E protein and lipid membrane when environment becomes acidic. CONCLUSION: At acidic condition, E proteins are attracted to the membrane-associated prM-stem. SIGNIFICANCE: prM-stem region induces virus structural changes during maturation. Newly assembled dengue viruses (DENV) undergo maturation to become infectious particles. The maturation process involves major rearrangement of virus surface premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins. The prM-E complexes on immature viruses are first assembled as trimeric spikes in the neutral pH environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. When the virus is transported to the low pH environment of the exosomes, these spikes rearrange into dimeric structures, which lie parallel to the virus lipid envelope. The proteins involved in driving this process are unknown. Previous cryoelectron microscopy studies of the mature DENV showed that the prM-stem region (residues 111-131) is membrane-associated and may interact with the E proteins. Here we investigated the prM-stem region in modulating the virus maturation process. The binding of the prM-stem region to the E protein was shown to increase significantly at low pH compared with neutral pH in ELISAs and surface plasmon resonance studies. In addition, the affinity of the prM-stem region for the liposome, as measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, was also increased when pH is lowered. These results suggest that the prM-stem region forms a tight association with the virus membrane and attracts the associated E protein in the low pH environment of exosomes. This will lead to the surface protein rearrangement observed during maturation.

This study investigated the genetic variants of the capsid-premembrane junction region fragment in the dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 (DENV1-2). METHODS: Samples from 11 municipalities in the State of Paraná, Brazil, were provided by the Central Laboratory of Paraná. They were isolated from the cell culture line C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and were positive for indirect immunofluorescence. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from these samples was submitted to the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR revealed that 4 of the samples were co-infected with both serotypes. The isolated DENV-1 sequences were 95-100% similar to the sequences of other serotype 1 strains deposited in GenBank. Similarly, the isolated DENV-2 sequences were 98-100% similar to other serotype 2 sequences in GenBank. According to our neighbor-joining tree, all strains obtained in this study belonged to genotype V of DENV-1. The DENV-2 strains, by contrast, belonged to the American/Asian genotypes.

17293987,2006 Dec,Morphological studies in a model for dengue-2 virus infection in mice.,"One of the main difficulties in studying dengue virus infection in humans and in developing a vaccine is the absence of a suitable animal model which develops the full spectrum of dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. It is our proposal to present morphological aspects of an animal model which shows many similarities with the dengue infection in humans. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally infected with non-neuroadapted dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Histopathological and morphometrical analyses of liver tissue revealed focal alterations along the infection, reaching wide-ranging portal and centrolobular veins congestion and sinusoidal cell death. Additional ultrastructural observations demonstrated multifocal endothelial injury, platelet recruitment, and alterated hepatocytes. Dengue virus antigen was detected in hepatocytes and in the capillar endothelium of the central lobular vein area. Liver function tests showed high levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase enzyme activity. Lung tissue showed interstitial pneumonia and mononuclear cells, interseptal oedema, hyperplasia, and hypertrophy of the bronchiolar epithelial cells. DENV-2 led to a transient inflammatory process, but caused focal alterations of the blood-exchange barrier. Viremia was observed from 2nd to 11th day p.i. by isolation of DENV-2 in C6/36 mosquito cell line inoculated with the supernatant of macerated liver, lung, kidney, and cerebellum tissues of the infected mice.

12504563,2002 Dec 20,Mycophenolic acid inhibits dengue virus infection by preventing replication of viral RNA.,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease of global importance with no available antiviral therapy. We assessed the ability of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a drug currently used as an immunosuppressive agent, to inhibit dengue virus (DV) antigen expression, RNA replication, and virus production. Pharmacological concentrations of MPA effectively blocked DV infection, decreasing the percentage of infected cells by 99% and the levels of secreted virus by up to a millionfold. Results were reproduced with four hepatoma cell lines and different flaviviruses, including a recent West Nile virus isolate. Experiments were performed to define the stage in the viral lifecycle at which MPA abrogates infection. Early steps in viral infection, such as viral entry and nucleocapsid uncoating, were not the primary targets of MPA action since its inhibitory effect was retained when naked DV RNA was transfected directly into cells. Biosynthetic labeling experiments showed that MPA did not block the initial phase of viral translation but did interfere with viral protein synthesis in the amplification phase. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that MPA prevented the accumulation of viral positive- and negative-strand RNA as the infection proceeded. We conclude that MPA inhibits flavivirus infection by preventing synthesis and accumulation of viral RNA.

22563516,2012,Correlation of serotype-specific dengue virus infection with clinical manifestations.,"BACKGROUND: Disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV) is a significant cause of morbidity throughout the world. Although prior research has focused on the association of specific DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) with the development of severe outcomes such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, relatively little work has correlated other clinical manifestations with a particular DENV serotype. The goal of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence of non-hemorrhagic clinical manifestations of DENV infection by serotype. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between the years 2005-2010, individuals with febrile disease from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Paraguay were enrolled in an outpatient passive surveillance study. Detailed information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, as well as demographic information, was collected. DENV infection was confirmed in patient sera with polyclonal antibodies in a culture-based immunofluorescence assay, and the infecting serotype was determined by serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies. Differences in the prevalence of individual and organ-system manifestations were compared across DENV serotypes. One thousand seven hundred and sixteen individuals were identified as being infected with DENV-1 (39.8%), DENV-2 (4.3%), DENV-3 (41.5%), or DENV-4 (14.4%). When all four DENV serotypes were compared with each other, individuals infected with DENV-3 had a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal manifestations, and individuals infected with DENV-4 had a higher prevalence of respiratory and cutaneous manifestations.

27076639,2016 Jun 15,Dynamic Nucleolar Targeting of Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 in Response to Extracellular pH.,"The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE: Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental changes.

21284832,2011 Feb 1,"Detection of dengue-4 virus in pune, western india after an absence of 30 years--its association with two severe cases.","BACKGROUND: Difference in severity of dengue outbreaks has been related to virus serotype, genotype and clades within genotypes. Till the 1980 s, India and Sri Lanka reported low number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases despite circulation of all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Since the 1990 s the occurrence of DHF has increased. The increase has been attributed to changes in virus lineage especially with regard to DENV-2 and DENV-3. DENV-1 has been associated with dengue fever (DF) outbreaks and DENV-4 reports have been rare. The emergence of DENV-4 was reported recently in 2003 in Delhi and in 2007 in Hyderabad. The last report of DENV-4 from Maharashtra was in 1975 from Amalner. RESULTS: We report on the detection of DENV-4 in Pune, Maharashtra after an absence of almost 30 years. Two cases were detected in 2009-10, serotyped by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both the cases were recorded as severe dengue (Category 3) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level of treatment. Depending on the hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody titres the 2009 case was characterized as a primary infection and the 2010 case as a secondary infection. Both the cases presented plasma leakage and neither showed any kind of haemorrhage. The 2009 case survived while the 2010 case was fatal. An isolate was obtained from the 2009 case.

24342140,2014 Feb 13,Development of a novel DNA-launched dengue virus type 2 infectious clone assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome.,"Major progress in Dengue virus (DENV) biology has resulted from the use of infectious clones obtained through reverse genetics. The construction of these clones is commonly based on high- or low-copy number plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Prokaryotic promoters have consistently been used for the transcription of these clones. The goal of this study was to develop a novel DENV infectious clone in a BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and to generate a virus with the fusion envelope-green fluorescent protein in an attempt to track virus infection. The transfection of Vero cells with a plasmid encoding the DENV infectious clone facilitated the recovery of infectious particles that increased in titer after serial passages in C6/36 cells. The plaque size and syncytia phenotypes of the recombinant virus were similar to those of the parental virus. Despite the observation of autonomous replication and the detection of low levels of viral genome after two passages, the insertion of green fluorescent protein and Renilla luciferase reporter genes negatively impacted virus rescue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a DENV infectious clone under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to facilitate the recovery of recombinant viruses without the need for in vitro transcription. This novel molecular clone will be useful for establishing the molecular basis of replication, assembly, and pathogenesis, evaluating potential antiviral drugs, and the development of vaccine candidates for attenuated recombinant viruses.

9420267,1998 Jan,Mutagenesis of the NS3 protease of dengue virus type 2.,"The flavivirus protease is composed of two viral proteins, NS2B and NS3. The amino-terminal portion of NS3 contains sequence and structural motifs characteristic of bacterial and cellular trypsin-like proteases. We have undertaken a mutational analysis of the region of NS3 which contains the catalytic serine, five putative substrate binding residues, and several residues that are highly conserved among flavivirus proteases and among all serine proteases. In all, 46 single-amino-acid substitutions were created in a cloned NS2B-NS3 cDNA fragment of dengue virus type 2, and the effect of each mutation on the extent of self-cleavage of the NS2B-NS3 precursor at the NS2B-NS3 junction was assayed in vivo. Twelve mutations almost completely or completely inhibited protease activity, 9 significantly reduced it, 14 decreased cleavage, and 11 yielded wild-type levels of activity. Substitution of alanine at ultraconserved residues abolished NS3 protease activity. Cleavage was also inhibited by substituting some residues that are conserved among flavivirus NS3 proteins. Two (Y150 and G153) of the five putative substrate binding residues could not be replaced by alanine, and only Y150 and N152 could be replaced by a conservative change. The two other putative substrate binding residues, D129 and F130, were more freely substitutable. By analogy with the trypsin model, it was proposed that D129 is located at the bottom of the substrate binding pocket so as to directly interact with the basic amino acid at the substrate cleavage site. Interestingly, we found that significant cleavage activity was displayed by mutants in which D129 was replaced by E, S, or A and that low but detectable protease activity was exhibited by mutants in which D129 was replaced by K, R, or L. Contrary to the proposed model, these results indicate that D129 is not a major determinant of substrate binding and that its interaction with the substrate, if it occurs at all, is not essential. This mutagenesis study provided us with an array of mutations that alter the cleavage efficiency of the dengue virus protease. Mutations that decrease protease activity without abolishing it are candidates for introduction into the dengue virus infectious full-length cDNA clone with the aim of creating potentially attenuated virus stocks.

In this study, we report the re-introduction of DENV2 in the coast of São Paulo State. Partial envelope viral genes were sequenced from eighteen patients with dengue fever during the 2010 epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis showed this strain belongs to the American/Asian genotype and was closely related to the virus that circulated in Rio de Janeiro in 2007 and 2008. The phylogeny also showed no clustering by clinical presentation, suggesting that the disease severity could not be explained by distinct variants or genotypes. The time of the most recent common ancestor of American/Asian genotype and the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (SP/RJ) monophyletic cluster was estimated to be around 40 and 10 years, respectively.

27185466,2016 May 17,Molecular determinants of plaque size as an indicator of dengue virus attenuation.,"The development of live viral vaccines relies on empirically derived phenotypic criteria, especially small plaque sizes, to indicate attenuation. However, while some candidate vaccines successfully translated into licensed applications, others have failed safety trials, placing vaccine development on a hit-or-miss trajectory. We examined the determinants of small plaque phenotype in two dengue virus (DENV) vaccine candidates, DENV-3 PGMK30FRhL3, which produced acute febrile illness in vaccine recipients, and DENV-2 PDK53, which has a good clinical safety profile. The reasons behind the failure of PGMK30FRhL3 during phase 1 clinical trial, despite meeting the empirically derived criteria of attenuation, have never been systematically investigated. Using in vitro, in vivo and functional genomics approaches, we examined infections by the vaccine and wild-type DENVs, in order to ascertain the different determinants of plaque size. We show that PGMK30FRhL3 produces small plaques on BHK-21 cells due to its slow in vitro growth rate. In contrast, PDK53 replicates rapidly, but is unable to evade antiviral responses that constrain its spread hence also giving rise to small plaques. Therefore, at least two different molecular mechanisms govern the plaque phenotype; determining which mechanism operates to constrain plaque size may be more informative on the safety of live-attenuated vaccines.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dengue Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/growth & development/immunology/*physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/adverse effects', '*Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virulence']","['The development of live viral vaccines relies on empirically derived phenotypic criteria, especially small plaque sizes, to indicate attenuation.', 'However, while some candidate vaccines successfully translated into licensed applications, others have failed safety trials, placing vaccine development on a hit-or-miss trajectory.', 'We examined the determinants of small plaque phenotype in two dengue virus (DENV) vaccine candidates, DENV-3 PGMK30FRhL3, which produced acute febrile illness in vaccine recipients, and DENV-2 PDK53, which has a good clinical safety profile.', 'The reasons behind the failure of PGMK30FRhL3 during phase 1 clinical trial, despite meeting the empirically derived criteria of attenuation, have never been systematically investigated.', 'Using in vitro, in vivo and functional genomics approaches, we examined infections by the vaccine and wild-type DENVs, in order to ascertain the different determinants of plaque size.', 'We show that PGMK30FRhL3 produces small plaques on BHK-21 cells due to its slow in vitro growth rate.', 'In contrast, PDK53 replicates rapidly, but is unable to evade antiviral responses that constrain its spread hence also giving rise to small plaques.', 'Therefore, at least two different molecular mechanisms govern the plaque phenotype; determining which mechanism operates to constrain plaque size may be more informative on the safety of live-attenuated vaccines.']"

18620509,2008 Dec,Density-dependent competitive suppression of sylvatic dengue virus by endemic dengue virus in cultured mosquito cells.,"Mosquito-borne dengue viruses are maintained in two discrete transmission cycles: a sylvatic cycle between nonhuman primates and sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes, and an endemic cycle between humans and peridomestic Aedes (primarily Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus). Most sylvatic strains are genetically distinct from endemic strains, and human infections with sylvatic strains have been detected only rarely. Interestingly, sylvatic strains replicate as well as endemic strains in Ae. aegypti and experimental models of replication in humans, suggesting that adaptive constraints may not explain the limited spillover of sylvatic strains into the endemic cycle. Within-host competition is another mechanism known to decrease emergence of strains into occupied niches. In the current study, we examined the magnitude of competitive suppression between sylvatic and endemic dengue strains of different serotypes in pair-wise mixed infections of cultured Ae. albopictus cells to test whether the ecotype or the initial ratio of the two strains influenced the outcome of competition. Strains isolated from nonhuman primates were competitively inferior to those isolated from humans. Moreover, competition was density-dependent; the magnitude of suppression increased as the starting density of a strain relative to its competitor decreased. These data suggest that competitive inferiority in endemic vectors coupled with a numerical disadvantage relative to resident endemic strains could restrict reemergence of sylvatic strains into the endemic cycle and contribute to the ecologically correlated genetic divergence between sylvatic and endemic strains. kmp29@psu.edu","['Aedes/*cytology/*virology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']","['Mosquito-borne dengue viruses are maintained in two discrete transmission cycles: a sylvatic cycle between nonhuman primates and sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes, and an endemic cycle between humans and peridomestic Aedes (primarily Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus).', 'Most sylvatic strains are genetically distinct from endemic strains, and human infections with sylvatic strains have been detected only rarely.', 'Interestingly, sylvatic strains replicate as well as endemic strains in Ae. aegypti and experimental models of replication in humans, suggesting that adaptive constraints may not explain the limited spillover of sylvatic strains into the endemic cycle.', 'Within-host competition is another mechanism known to decrease emergence of strains into occupied niches.', 'In the current study, we examined the magnitude of competitive suppression between sylvatic and endemic dengue strains of different serotypes in pair-wise mixed infections of cultured Ae. albopictus cells to test whether the ecotype or the initial ratio of the two strains influenced the outcome of competition.', 'Strains isolated from nonhuman primates were competitively inferior to those isolated from humans.', 'Moreover, competition was density-dependent; the magnitude of suppression increased as the starting density of a strain relative to its competitor decreased.', 'These data suggest that competitive inferiority in endemic vectors coupled with a numerical disadvantage relative to resident endemic strains could restrict reemergence of sylvatic strains into the endemic cycle and contribute to the ecologically correlated genetic divergence between sylvatic and endemic strains.', 'kmp29@psu.edu']"
24647259,2014,Sequence variation of dengue type 2 virus isolated from clinical cases in Thailand.,"Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are caused by mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) infection leading to death in tropical and subtropical countries. In Thailand, all 4 serotypes of DENV are circulating. The most severe cases of DF and DHF are primarily introduced by secondary infections. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that approximately 20% of the primary infection cases were caused by DENV-1 and -3, while the cases of DENV-2 or -4 accounted for less than 3%. For this reason, DENV-2 and -4 from primary infections have not been well studied. In this study, the sequence diversity of the envelope gene of 8 DENV-2 clinical isolates from primary/secondary infections was analyzed. DENV-2 from primary infections were highly heterogeneous in individual patients, whereas those from secondary infections were homogeneous. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the heterogeneous population of DENV-2 from primary infections was composed of closely related quasispecies. Homogenous DENV-2 could be derived from selection of a particular viral population in secondary infections.

22990972,2012 Sep,Molecular characterisation of dengue virus type 1 reveals lineage replacement during circulation in Brazilian territory.,"Dengue fever is the most important arbovirus infection found in tropical regions around the world. Dispersal of the vector and an increase in migratory flow between countries have led to large epidemics and severe clinical outcomes, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. This study analysed the genetic variability of the dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) in Brazil with regard to the full-length structural genes C/prM/M/E among 34 strains isolated during epidemics that occurred in the country between 1994-2011.

20663532,2010 Sep 30,Natural attenuation of dengue virus type-2 after a series of island outbreaks: a retrospective phylogenetic study of events in the South Pacific three decades ago.,"Dengue is an expanding arboviral disease of variable severity characterized by the emergence of virus strains with greater fitness, epidemic potential and possibly virulence. To investigate the role of dengue virus (DENV) strain variation on epidemic activity we studied DENV-2 viruses from a series of South Pacific islands experiencing outbreaks of varying intensity and clinical severity. Initially appearing in 1971 in Tahiti and Fiji, the virus was responsible for subsequent epidemics in American Samoa, New Caledonia and Niue Island in 1972, reaching Tonga in 1973 where there was near-silent transmission for over a year. Based on whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on 20 virus isolates, Tonga viruses were genetically unique, clustering in a single clade. Substitutions in the pre-membrane (prM) and nonstructural genes NS2A and NS4A correlated with the attenuation of the Tongan viruses and suggest that genetic change may play a significant role in dengue epidemic severity.

22716071,2012 Jun 20,Phylogenetic relationship of dengue virus type 3 isolated in Brazil and Paraguay and global evolutionary divergence dynamics.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. Dengue virus comprises four antigenically related viruses named dengue virus type 1 to 4 (DENV1-4). DENV-3 was re-introduced into the Americas in 1994 causing outbreaks in Nicaragua and Panama. DENV-3 was introduced in Brazil in 2000 and then spread to most of the Brazilian States, reaching the neighboring country, Paraguay in 2002. In this study, we have analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of DENV-3 isolated in Brazil and Paraguay with viruses isolated worldwide. We have also analyzed the evolutionary divergence dynamics of DENV-3 viruses. RESULTS: The entire open reading frame (ORF) of thirteen DENV-3 isolated in Brazil (n = 9) and Paraguay (n = 4) were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. DENV-3 grouped into three main genotypes (I, II and III). Several internal clades were found within each genotype that we called lineage and sub-lineage. Viruses included in this study belong to genotype III and grouped together with viruses isolated in the Americas within the lineage III. The Brazilian viruses were further segregated into two different sub-lineage, A and B, and the Paraguayan into the sub-lineage B. All three genotypes showed internal grouping. The nucleotide divergence was in average 6.7% for genotypes, 2.7% for lineages and 1.5% for sub-lineages. Phylogenetic trees constructed with any of the protein gene sequences showed the same segregation of the DENV-3 in three genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that two groups of DENV-3 genotypes III circulated in Brazil during 2002-2009, suggesting different events of introduction of the virus through different regions of the country. In Paraguay, only one group DENV-3 genotype III is circulating that is very closely related to the Brazilian viruses of sub-lineage B. Different degree of grouping can be observed for DENV-3 and each group showed a characteristic evolutionary divergence. Finally, we have observed that any protein gene sequence can be used to identify the virus genotype. de São Paulo, Av, do Café s/n., 14040-903, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.","['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Evolution, Molecular', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraguay/epidemiology', '*Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology']","['BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide.', 'Dengue virus comprises four antigenically related viruses named dengue virus type 1 to 4 (DENV1-4).', 'DENV-3 was re-introduced into the Americas in 1994 causing outbreaks in Nicaragua and Panama.', 'DENV-3 was introduced in Brazil in 2000 and then spread to most of the Brazilian States, reaching the neighboring country, Paraguay in 2002.', 'In this study, we have analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of DENV-3 isolated in Brazil and Paraguay with viruses isolated worldwide.', 'We have also analyzed the evolutionary divergence dynamics of DENV-3 viruses.', 'RESULTS: The entire open reading frame (ORF) of thirteen DENV-3 isolated in Brazil (n\u2009=\u20099) and Paraguay (n\u2009=\u20094) were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis.', 'DENV-3 grouped into three main genotypes (I, II and III).', 'Several internal clades were found within each genotype that we called lineage and sub-lineage.', 'Viruses included in this study belong to genotype III and grouped together with viruses isolated in the Americas within the lineage III.', 'The Brazilian viruses were further segregated into two different sub-lineage, A and B, and the Paraguayan into the sub-lineage B.', 'All three genotypes showed internal grouping.', 'The nucleotide divergence was in average 6.7% for genotypes, 2.7% for lineages and 1.5% for sub-lineages.', 'Phylogenetic trees constructed with any of the protein gene sequences showed the same segregation of the DENV-3 in three genotypes.', 'CONCLUSION: Our results showed that two groups of DENV-3 genotypes III circulated in Brazil during 2002-2009, suggesting different events of introduction of the virus through different regions of the country.', 'In Paraguay, only one group DENV-3 genotype III is circulating that is very closely related to the Brazilian viruses of sub-lineage B.', 'Different degree of grouping can be observed for DENV-3 and each group showed a characteristic evolutionary divergence.', 'Finally, we have observed that any protein gene sequence can be used to identify the virus genotype.', 'de São Paulo, Av, do Café s/n., 14040-903, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.']"
28471365,2017 May 1,Structural features of NS3 of Dengue virus serotypes 2 and 4 in solution and insight into RNA binding and the inhibitory role of quercetin.,"Dengue virus (DENV), which has four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), is the causative agent of the viral infection dengue. DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) comprises a serine protease domain and an RNA helicase domain which has nucleotide triphosphatase activities that are essential for RNA replication and viral assembly. Here, solution X-ray scattering was used to provide insight into the overall structure and flexibility of the entire NS3 and its recombinant helicase and protease domains for Dengue virus serotypes 2 and 4 in solution. The DENV-2 and DENV-4 NS3 forms are elongated and flexible in solution. The importance of the linker residues in flexibility and domain-domain arrangement was shown by the compactness of the individual protease and helicase domains. Swapping of the (174)PPAVP(179) linker stretch of the related Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 into DENV-2 NS3 did not alter the elongated shape of the engineered mutant. Conformational alterations owing to RNA binding are described in the protease domain, which undergoes substantial conformational alterations that are required for the optimal catalysis of bound RNA. Finally, the effects of ATPase inhibitors on the enzymatically active DENV-2 and DENV-4 NS3 and the individual helicases are presented, and insight into the allosteric effect of the inhibitor quercetin is provided.

18439289,2008 Apr 25,Use of a commercial enzyme immunoassay to monitor dengue virus replication in cultured cells.,"Current methods for dengue virus quantitation are either time consuming, technically demanding or costly. As an alternative, the commercial enzyme immunoassay Platelia Dengue NS1 AG (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to monitor semiquantitatively dengue virus replication in cultured cells. The presence of NS1 protein was evaluated in supernatants from Vero and C6/36 HT cells infected with dengue virus. The amount of NS1 detected in the supernatants of infected cells was proportional to the initial MOI used and to the time of post infection harvest. This immunoassay was also able to detect the presence of NS1 in the supernatants of infected human macrophages. Inhibition of dengue virus replication in C6/36 HT cells treated with lysosomotropic drugs was readily monitored with the use of this assay.

34928951,2021 Dec,"The epidemiological characteristics of dengue in high-risk areas of China, 2013-2016.","INTRODUCTION: Dengue has become a more serious human health concern in China, with increased incidence and expanded outbreak regions. The knowledge of the cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological characteristics and the evolutionary dynamics of dengue in high-risk areas of China is limited. METHODS: Records of dengue cases from 2013 to 2016 were obtained from the China Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Full envelope gene sequences of dengue viruses detected from the high-risk areas of China were collected. Maximum Likelihood tree and haplotype network analyses were conducted to explore the phylogenetic relationship of viruses from high-risk areas of China. RESULTS: A total of 56,520 cases was reported in China from 2013 to 2016. During this time, Yunnan, Guangdong and Fujian provinces were the high-risk areas. Imported cases occurred almost year-round, and were mainly introduced from Southeast Asia. The first indigenous case usually occurred in June to August, and the last one occurred before December in Yunnan and Fujian provinces but in December in Guangdong Province. Seven genotypes of DENV 1-3 were detected in the high-risk areas, with DENV 1-I the main genotype and DENV 2-Cosmopolitan the secondary one. The Maximum Likelihood trees show that almost all the indigenous viruses separated into different clusters. DENV 1-I viruses were found to be clustered in Guangdong Province, but not in Fujian and Yunnan, from 2013 to 2015. The ancestors of the Guangdong viruses in the cluster in 2013 and 2014 were most closely related to strains from Thailand or Singapore, and the Guangdong virus in 2015 was most closely related to the Guangdong virus of 2014. Based on closest phylogenetic relationships, viruses from Myanmar possibly initiated further indigenous cases in Yunnan, those from Indonesia in Fujian, while viruses from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia were predominant in Guangdong Province. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is still an imported disease in China, although some genotypes continued to circulate in successive years. Viral phylogenies based on the envelope gene suggested periodic introductions of dengue strains into China, primarily from Southeast Asia, with occasional sustained, multi-year transmission in some regions of China.

By passaging DENV2 in baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells, we isolated a mutant clone of DENV2 that shows rapid cytopathic effects in BHK-21 cells as compared with that showed by the parent strain. To investigate the relationship between amino acid mutations and proliferation activity of the isolated DENV2 clone, we performed full genome sequencing and identified 3 amino acid mutations in the coding region, the envelope T120K, NS4A M85T, and NS4B G124A. Genetically modified recombinant DENV2 (rDENV2) carrying the NS4A M85T and NS4B G124A mutations produced higher titers of progeny virus in BHK-21, Vero, and Huh-7 cells than in the wild-type (WT) rDENV2. rDENV2 with mutations at NS4A M85T and NS4B G124A failed to produce any plaques in C6/36 mosquito cell lines. Furthermore, rDENV2 possessing only the NS4B G124A mutation showed no plaque production in C6/36 cells but had higher viral titers in Vero and Huh-7 cells than the WT rDENV2 had. Our results clearly showed that the DENV2 NS4B G124A mutation has opposing effects on the virus proliferation in mosquito and certain mammalian cell lines. Hokkaido University. Hokkaido University.

20386713,2010 Apr 8,Peptide inhibitors of dengue-virus entry target a late-stage fusion intermediate.,"The mechanism of membrane fusion by ""class II"" viral fusion proteins follows a pathway that involves large-scale domain rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein (E) and a transition from dimers to trimers. The rearrangement is believed to proceed by an outward rotation of the E ectodomain after loss of the dimer interface, followed by a reassociation into extended trimers. The approximately 55-aa-residue, membrane proximal ""stem"" can then zip up along domain II, bringing together the transmembrane segments of the C-terminus and the fusion loops at the tip of domain II. We find that peptides derived from the stem of dengue-virus E bind stem-less E trimer, which models a conformational intermediate. In vitro assays demonstrate that these peptides specifically block viral fusion. The peptides inhibit infectivity with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformational intermediate, even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. We conclude that peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes, the compartment in which acidification initiates fusion. Binding depends on particle dynamics, as there is no inhibition of infectivity if preincubation and separation are at 4 degrees C rather than 37 degrees C. We propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition. Targeting a viral entry pathway can be an effective way to block infection. Our data, which support and extend proposed mechanisms for how the E conformational change promotes membrane fusion, suggest strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry.

26527283,2015 Nov 2,One-step real-time RT-PCR assays for serotyping dengue virus in clinical samples.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the leading causes of morbidity in tropical and subtropical regions and infection with any of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) result in a wide range of clinical manifestations. Given the geographic expansion of DENV1-4, assays for serotyping are needed to be able to perform surveillance and epidemiological studies. In this study, we describe the design and validation of one-step real-time serotype-specific DENV RT-PCR assays. METHODS: The DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 RT-PCR assays were designed using all available whole genome DENV sequences in the NCBI nucleotide collection. Because of the high mutation rates of RNA viruses, the assays were performed in singleplex format to enable quick modifications to the primer and probe sequences when new genetic variants emerge. The analytical performance of the RT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro transcribed RNA and their specificity was determined by testing 24 DENV isolates, external DENV control panels and RNA preparation of non-DENV flaviviruses and non-dengue clinical samples. Additionally, the clinical performance of the serotype-specific DENV RT-PCR were compared to that of the CDC DENV-1-4 RT-PCR using 85 clinical samples collected from patients presenting with acute dengue. RESULTS: The RT-PCR assays were found to be specific for their respective serotype and did not cross-react with other flaviviruses or human mRNA. All assays had a linear dynamic range of 10(2) to 10(6) copies/reaction with detection limits between 12 and 44 copies/reaction. When testing sera from 85 confirmed acute dengue cases, the serotype-specific DENV RT-PCR assays had 100 % positive agreement with the FDA-approved CDC DENV-1-4 RT-PCR assay performed in a singleplex format. Additionally 15 samples that tested negative in the CDC DENV-1-4- RT-PCR assay were found positive using the serotype-specific DENV RT-PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that these RT-PCR assays are useful alternatives to existing methods for serotyping DENV in clinical sera. Sweden. erik.alm@folkhalsomyndigheten.se.

31332207,2019 Jul 22,Thermodynamic study of the effect of ions on the interaction between dengue virus NS3 helicase and single stranded RNA.,"Dengue virus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) fulfills multiple essential functions during the viral replication and constitutes a prominent drug target. NS3 is composed by a superfamily-2 RNA helicase domain joined to a serine protease domain. Quantitative fluorescence titrations employing a fluorescein-tagged RNA oligonucleotide were used to investigate the effect of salts on the interaction between NS3 and single stranded RNA (ssRNA). We found a strong dependence of the observed equilibrium binding constant, K(obs), with the salt concentration, decreasing at least 7-fold for a 1-fold increase on cation concentration. As a result of the effective neutralization of ~10 phosphate groups, binding of helicase domain of NS3 to ssRNA is accompanied by the release of 5 or 7 monovalent cations from an oligonucleotide or a polynucleotide, respectively and of 3 divalent cations from the same oligonucleotide. Such estimates are not affected by the type of cation, either monovalent (KCl, NaCl and RbCl) or divalent (MgCl(2) and CaCl(2)), nor by the presence of the protease domain or the fluorescein label. Combined effect of mono and divalent cations was well described by a simple equilibrium binding model which allows to predict the values of K(obs) at any concentration of cations. de Buenos Aires and Instituto de Química y Fisicoquímica Biológicas-CONICET, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, C1113AAD, Argentina. de Buenos Aires and Instituto de Química y Fisicoquímica Biológicas-CONICET, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, C1113AAD, Argentina. de Buenos Aires and Instituto de Química y Fisicoquímica Biológicas-CONICET, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, C1113AAD, Argentina. de Buenos Aires and Instituto de Química y Fisicoquímica Biológicas-CONICET, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, C1113AAD, Argentina.

A technique for the multiplex detection and typing of DENV serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV-1 to DENV-4) from clinical samples by PCR-ligase detection reaction (LDR) has been developed. A serotype-specific PCR amplifies the regions of genes C and E simultaneously. The two amplicons are targeted in a multiplex LDR, and the resultant fluorescently labeled ligation products are detected on a universal array. The assay was optimized using 38 DENV strains and was evaluated with 350 archived acute-phase serum samples. The sensitivity of the assay was 98.7%, and its specificity was 98.4%, relative to the results of real-time PCR. The detection threshold was 0.017 PFU for DENV-1, 0.004 PFU for DENV-2, 0.8 PFU for DENV-3, and 0.7 PFU for DENV-4. The assay is specific; it does not cross-react with the other flaviviruses tested (West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Kunjin virus, Murray Valley virus, Powassan virus, and yellow fever virus).

24397875,2014 Mar,Clinical significance of intra-host variability of Dengue-1 virus in venous and capillary blood.,"Dengue fever represents a major public health problem. Both viral and host immune factors are involved in severe infections. Humans and mosquito-vectors are infected with diverse viral populations that may play a role in viral adaptation and disease pathogenesis. Our objective was to analyse the intra-host genetic variability of dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) in the venous and capillary blood and its relationships with the clinical presentation of dengue fever. Early serum samples were collected in 2009 from ten DENV-1-infected patients hospitalized in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. Partial viral envelope sequences were analysed at the inter-host and intra-host level. For each patient, an average of 56 clone sequences was analysed both in the venous sector and the capillary sector (from right and left hands). The ten consensus sequences were highly similar. The intra-host DENV-1 genetic variability was significantly lower in the venous sector than in the capillary sector, and in patients with haemorrhagic symptoms than in those without haemorrhagic symptoms, particularly in capillary samples. No relation was found with sex, age, dengue IgG-serological status, day of serum sampling, or viral load. Significant relationships were found between the clinical presentation of dengue fever and the variability of viral populations within hosts, particularly in capillary samples. The observed variability of envelope sequences at the early phase of dengue infection was not critically influenced by the previous dengue serological status of patients. An important part of viral microevolution may occur in the capillary sector and influence the mechanisms of severe forms. Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

33173007,2020 Nov 10,A Targeted Computational Screen of the SWEETLEAD Database Reveals FDA-Approved Compounds with Anti-Dengue Viral Activity.,"Affordable and effective antiviral therapies are needed worldwide, especially against agents such as dengue virus that are endemic in underserved regions. Many antiviral compounds have been studied in cultured cells but are unsuitable for clinical applications due to pharmacokinetic profiles, side effects, or inconsistent efficacy across dengue serotypes. Such tool compounds can, however, aid in identifying clinically useful treatments. Here, computational screening (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures) was used to identify entries in an in silico database of safe-in-human compounds (SWEETLEAD) that display high chemical similarities to known inhibitors of dengue virus. Inhibitors of the dengue proteinase NS2B/3, the dengue capsid, and the host autophagy pathway were used as query compounds. Three FDA-approved compounds that resemble the tool molecules structurally, cause little toxicity, and display strong antiviral activity in cultured cells were selected for further analysis.

24150038,2014 Feb,Reconciling phylodynamics with epidemiology: the case of dengue virus in southern Vietnam.,"Coalescent methods are widely used to infer the demographic history of populations from gene genealogies. These approaches-often referred to as phylodynamic methods-have proven especially useful for reconstructing the dynamics of rapidly evolving viral pathogens. Yet, population dynamics inferred from viral genealogies often differ widely from those observed from other sources of epidemiological data, such as hospitalization records. We demonstrate how a modeling framework that allows for the direct fitting of mechanistic epidemiological models to genealogies can be used to test different hypotheses about what ecological factors cause phylodynamic inferences to differ from observed dynamics. We use this framework to test different hypotheses about why dengue serotype 1 (DENV-1) population dynamics in southern Vietnam inferred using existing phylodynamic methods differ from hospitalization data. Specifically, we consider how factors such as seasonality, vector dynamics, and spatial structure can affect inferences drawn from genealogies. The coalescent models we derive to take into account vector dynamics and spatial structure reveal that these ecological complexities can substantially affect coalescent rates among lineages. We show that incorporating these additional ecological complexities into coalescent models can also greatly improve estimates of historical population dynamics and lead to new insights into the factors shaping viral genealogies.","['Dengue/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Phylogeny', 'Phylogeography', '*Population Dynamics', 'Vietnam/epidemiology']","['Coalescent methods are widely used to infer the demographic history of populations from gene genealogies.', 'These approaches-often referred to as phylodynamic methods-have proven especially useful for reconstructing the dynamics of rapidly evolving viral pathogens.', 'Yet, population dynamics inferred from viral genealogies often differ widely from those observed from other sources of epidemiological data, such as hospitalization records.', 'We demonstrate how a modeling framework that allows for the direct fitting of mechanistic epidemiological models to genealogies can be used to test different hypotheses about what ecological factors cause phylodynamic inferences to differ from observed dynamics.', 'We use this framework to test different hypotheses about why dengue serotype 1 (DENV-1) population dynamics in southern Vietnam inferred using existing phylodynamic methods differ from hospitalization data.', 'Specifically, we consider how factors such as seasonality, vector dynamics, and spatial structure can affect inferences drawn from genealogies.', 'The coalescent models we derive to take into account vector dynamics and spatial structure reveal that these ecological complexities can substantially affect coalescent rates among lineages.', 'We show that incorporating these additional ecological complexities into coalescent models can also greatly improve estimates of historical population dynamics and lead to new insights into the factors shaping viral genealogies.']"

Acute phase serum samples were collected from 332 clinically diagnosed dengue patients during the peak season of dengue cases. Viremia levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and plaque assays using FcγRIIA-expressing and non-FcγRIIA-expressing BHK cells to specifically determine the infectious virus particles. By serology and molecular techniques, 280/332 (84·3%) were confirmed as dengue patients. All four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) were isolated from among 104 laboratory-confirmed patients including two cases infected with two DENV serotypes. High percentage of primary infection was noted among the severe dengue patients. Patients with primary infection or DENV IgM negative demonstrated significantly higher viral loads but there was no significant difference among the severity groups. Viremia levels among dengue patients were notably high for a long period which was assumed to support the spread of the virus by the mosquito vector during epidemic. Phylogenetic analyses of the envelope gene of the epidemic strains revealed close similarity with the strains previously isolated in Myanmar and neighboring countries. DENV-1 dominated the epidemic in 2015 and the serotype (except DENV-3) and genotype distributions were similar in both study sites.

11682539,2001 Nov,Development and evaluation of serotype- and group-specific fluorogenic reverse transcriptase PCR (TaqMan) assays for dengue virus.,"Five fluorogenic probe hydrolysis (TaqMan) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays were developed for serotypes 1 to 4 and group-specific detection of dengue virus. Serotype- and group-specific oligonucleotide primers and fluorogenic probes were designed against conserved regions of the dengue virus genome. The RT-PCR assay is a rapid single-tube method consisting of a 30-min RT step linked to a 45-cycle PCR at 95 and 60 degrees C that generates a fluorogenic signal in positive samples. Assays were initially evaluated against cell culture-derived dengue stock viruses and then with 67 dengue viremic human sera received from Peru, Indonesia, and Taiwan. The TaqMan assays were compared to virus isolation using C6/36 cells followed by an immunofluorescence assay using serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies. Viral titers in sera were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. The serotype-specific TaqMan RT-PCR assay detected 62 of 67 confirmed dengue virus-positive samples, for a sensitivity of 92.5%, while the group-specific assay detected 66 of 67 confirmed dengue virus-positive samples, for a sensitivity of 98.5%. The TaqMan RT-PCR assays have a specificity of 100% based on the serotype concordance of all assays compared to cell culture isolation and negative results obtained when 21 normal human sera and plasma samples were tested.

30226880,2018 Sep,Clinical manifestations of dengue in relation to dengue serotype and genotype in Malaysia: A retrospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Malaysia experienced an unprecedented dengue outbreak from the year 2014 to 2016 that resulted in an enormous increase in the number of cases and mortality as compared to previous years. The causes that attribute to a dengue outbreak can be multifactorial. Viral factors, such as dengue serotype and genotype, are the components of interest in this study. Although only a small number of studies investigated the association between the serotype of dengue virus and clinical manifestations, none of these studies included analyses on dengue genotypes. The present study aims to investigate dengue serotype and genotype-specific clinical characteristics among dengue fever and severe dengue cases from two Malaysian tertiary hospitals between 2014 and mid-2017. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 120 retrospective dengue serum specimens were subjected to serotyping and genotyping by Taqman Real-Time RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, the dengue serotype and genotype data were statistically analyzed for 101 of 120 corresponding patients' clinical manifestations to generate a descriptive relation between the genetic components and clinical outcomes of dengue infected patients. During the study period, predominant dengue serotype and genotype were found to be DENV 1 genotype I. Additionally, non-severe clinical manifestations were commonly observed in patients infected with DENV 1 and DENV 3. Meanwhile, patients with DENV 2 infection showed significant warning signs and developed severe dengue (p = 0.007). Cases infected with DENV 2 were also commonly presented with persistent vomiting (p = 0.010), epigastric pain (p = 0.018), plasma leakage (p = 0.004) and shock (p = 0.038). Moreover, myalgia and arthralgia were highly prevalent among DENV 3 infection (p = 0.015; p = 0.014). The comparison of genotype-specific clinical manifestations showed that DENV 2 Cosmopolitan was significantly common among severe dengue patients. An association was also found between genotype I of DENV 3 and myalgia. In a similar vein, genotype III of DENV 3 was significantly common among patients with arthralgia. CONCLUSION: The current data contended that different dengue serotype and genotype had caused distinct clinical characteristics in infected patients.

14613610,2003 Nov 7,Why are dengue virus serotypes so distantly related? Enhancement and limiting serotype similarity between dengue virus strains.,"Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever, has four major serotypes characterized by large genetic and immunological distances. We propose that the unusually large distances between the serotypes can be explained in the light of a process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) leading to increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement results from a new infection with a particular serotype in an individual with acquired immunity to a different serotype. Classical dengue fever causes negligible mortality, but ADE leads to the risk of developing the significantly more dangerous dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). A mathematical model is presented that describes the epidemiological dynamics of two serotypes of a pathogen where there is the possibility of co-infection and reinfection by a different serotype, along with increased mortality as a result of enhancement. We show that if there is no or slightly increased mortality after reinfection (enhancement), serotypes with a small immunological distance can stably coexist. This suggests that a cloud of serotypes with minor serological differences will constitute the viral population.

29548293,2018 Mar 16,Taraxacum officinale and Urtica dioica extracts inhibit dengue virus serotype 2 replication in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Urtica dioica, Taraxacum officinale, Calea integrifolia and Caesalpinia pulcherrima are widely used all over the world for treatment of different illnesses. In Mexico, these plants are traditionally used to alleviate or counteract rheumatism and inflammatory muscle diseases. In the present study we evaluated the activity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of these four plants, on the replication of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). METHODS: Extraction process was carried out in a Soxtherm® system at 60, 85 and 120 °C; a chemical fractionation in silica gel chromatography was performed and compounds present in the active fractions were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn. The cytotoxic concentration and the inhibitory effect of extracts or fractions on the DENV2 replication were analyzed in the BHK-21 cell line (plaque forming assay). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) and the selectivity index (SI) were calculated for the extracts and fractions. RESULTS: The methanolic extracts at 60 °C of T. officinale and U. dioica showed the higher inhibitory effects on DENV2 replication. After the chemical fractionation, the higher activity fraction was found for U. dioica and T. officinale, presenting IC(50) values of 165.7 ± 3.85 and 126.1 ± 2.80 μg/ml, respectively; SI values were 5.59 and 6.01 for each fraction. The compounds present in T. officinale, were luteolin and caffeoylquinic acids derivatives and quercertin diclycosides. The compounds in the active fraction of U. dioica, were, chlorogenic acid, quercertin derivatives and flavonol glycosides (quercetin and kaempferol). CONCLUSIONS: Two fractions from U. dioica and T. officinale methanolic extracts with anti-dengue activity were found. The compounds present in both fractions were identified, several recognized molecules have demonstrated activity against other viral species. Subsequent biological analysis of the molecules, alone or in combination, contained in the extracts will be carried out to develop therapeutics against DENV2. de Oriente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Km 4.5 Carr Federal Atlixco-Metepec, 74360, Metepec, Puebla, México.

19211734,2009 May,Genomic epidemiology of a dengue virus epidemic in urban Singapore.,"Dengue is one of the most important emerging diseases of humans, with no preventative vaccines or antiviral cures available at present. Although one-third of the world's population live at risk of infection, little is known about the pattern and dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) within outbreak situations. By exploiting genomic data from an intensively studied major outbreak, we are able to describe the molecular epidemiology of DENV at a uniquely fine-scaled temporal and spatial resolution. Two DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and DENV-3), and multiple component genotypes, spread concurrently and with similar epidemiological and evolutionary profiles during the initial outbreak phase of a major dengue epidemic that took place in Singapore during 2005. Although DENV-1 and DENV-3 differed in viremia and clinical outcome, there was no evidence for adaptive evolution before, during, or after the outbreak, indicating that ecological or immunological rather than virological factors were the key determinants of epidemic dynamics. mark.schreiber@novartis.com","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Culicidae', 'Dengue/blood/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Urban Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']","['Dengue is one of the most important emerging diseases of humans, with no preventative vaccines or antiviral cures available at present.', ""Although one-third of the world's population live at risk of infection, little is known about the pattern and dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) within outbreak situations."", 'By exploiting genomic data from an intensively studied major outbreak, we are able to describe the molecular epidemiology of DENV at a uniquely fine-scaled temporal and spatial resolution.', 'Two DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and DENV-3), and multiple component genotypes, spread concurrently and with similar epidemiological and evolutionary profiles during the initial outbreak phase of a major dengue epidemic that took place in Singapore during 2005.', 'Although DENV-1 and DENV-3 differed in viremia and clinical outcome, there was no evidence for adaptive evolution before, during, or after the outbreak, indicating that ecological or immunological rather than virological factors were the key determinants of epidemic dynamics.', 'mark.schreiber@novartis.com']"
15890901,2005 Jun,Long-range RNA-RNA interactions circularize the dengue virus genome.,"Secondary and tertiary RNA structures present in viral RNA genomes play essential regulatory roles during translation, RNA replication, and assembly of new viral particles. In the case of flaviviruses, RNA-RNA interactions between the 5' and 3' ends of the genome have been proposed to be required for RNA replication. We found that two RNA elements present at the ends of the dengue virus genome interact in vitro with high affinity. Visualization of individual molecules by atomic force microscopy revealed that physical interaction between these RNA elements results in cyclization of the viral RNA. Using RNA binding assays, we found that the putative cyclization sequences, known as 5' and 3' CS, present in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses, were necessary but not sufficient for RNA-RNA interaction. Additional sequences present at the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the viral RNA were also required for RNA-RNA complex formation. We named these sequences 5' and 3' UAR (upstream AUG region). In order to investigate the functional role of 5'-3' UAR complementarity, these sequences were mutated either separately, to destroy base pairing, or simultaneously, to restore complementarity in the context of full-length dengue virus RNA. Nonviable viruses were recovered after transfection of dengue virus RNA carrying mutations either at the 5' or 3' UAR, while the RNA containing the compensatory mutations was able to replicate. Since sequence complementarity between the ends of the genome is required for dengue virus viability, we propose that cyclization of the RNA is a required conformation for viral replication.

23410119,2013 Feb 14,Nucleotide substitutions in dengue virus serotypes from Asian and American countries: insights into intracodon recombination and purifying selection.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection represents a significant public health problem in many subtropical and tropical countries. Although genetically closely related, the four serotypes of DENV differ in antigenicity for which cross protection among serotypes is limited. It is also believed that both multi-serotype infection as well as the evolution of viral antigenicity may have confounding effects in increased dengue epidemics. Numerous studies have been performed that investigated genetic diversity of DENV, but the precise mechanism(s) of dengue virus evolution are not well understood. RESULTS: We investigated genome-wide genetic diversity and nucleotide substitution patterns in the four serotypes among samples collected from different countries in Asia and Central and South America and sequenced as part of the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases at the Broad Institute. We applied bioinformatics, statistical and coalescent simulation methods to investigate diversity of codon sequences of DENV samples representing the four serotypes. We show that fixation of nucleotide substitutions is more prominent among the inter-continental isolates (Asian and American) of serotypes 1, 2 and 3 compared to serotype 4 isolates (South and Central America) and are distributed in a non-random manner among the genes encoded by the virus. Nearly one third of the negatively selected sites are associated with fixed mutation sites within serotypes. Our results further show that of all the sites showing evidence of recombination, the majority (~84%) correspond to sites under purifying selection in the four serotypes. The analysis further shows that genetic recombination occurs within specific codons, albeit with low frequency (< 5% of all recombination sites) throughout the DENV genome of the four serotypes and reveals significant enrichment (p < 0.05) among sites under purifying selection in the virus. CONCLUSION: The study provides the first evidence for intracodon recombination in DENV and suggests that within codons, genetic recombination has a significant role in maintaining extensive purifying selection of DENV in natural populations. Our study also suggests that fixation of beneficial mutations may lead to virus evolution via translational selection of specific sites in the DENV genome.

We determined that at 24 h postinfection, the number of infected cells detected by FACS represented the first round of infection and therefore could be used as a readout of the number of infectious particles in the inoculum. When the titers of different laboratory and clinical strains of DENV were compared using FACS, plaque, and endpoint dilution assays, for most strains the FACS titers were comparable to titers obtained by plaque or endpoint dilution assays. The FACS assay is an improvement over the plaque assay because the infection period is reduced from 5 to 7 days to 24 h and the assay can be used to titrate clinical isolates that frequently do not form clear plaques on cell monolayers.

32126080,2020 Mar,"Genomic epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever in Guangdong province, China from 2013 to 2017.","Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, has been endemic in many Southeast Asian countries. Since its first outbreak in 1978 in Foshan, Guangdong province, China, dengue has been continually epidemic in recent years in Guangdong, which raised the concern whether dengue infection is endemic in Guangdong. In this study, we performed phylogenetic, recombinant, and nucleotide variation analyses of 114 complete genome sequences of dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV1-4) collected from 2013 to 2017 in 18 of 21 cities of Guangdong. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that DENV sequences did not form a single cluster, indicating that dengue fever was not endemic in Guangdong, although DENV1-4 co-circulated in Guangdong. Twenty intra-serotype recombinant isolates involving DENV1-4 were detected, but no inter-serotype recombinant events were identified in this study. Additionally, the most recombinant events were detected simultaneously in the gene NS3 of DENV1-4. Nucleotide variation analyses showed that no significant intra-serotype differences were observed, whereas more significant inter-subtype differences were discovered in non-structural genes than in structural genes. Our investigation will facilitate the understanding of the current prevalent status of dengue fever in Guangdong and contribute to designing more effective preventive and control strategies for dengue infection.

7871753,1995 Feb 20,Growth-restricted dengue virus mutants containing deletions in the 5' noncoding region of the RNA genome.,"The dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) RNA genome contains a 101-nt 5' noncoding (NC) sequence which is predicted to form a stable secondary structure. DEN4 cDNA from which infectious RNA can be transcribed was used to engineer deletions in the 5' NC region for functional analysis of RNA structure and for isolation of DEN4 mutants that could be evaluated as candidates for use in a live attenuated vaccine. Eleven distinct deletions in the region of the DEN4 genome between nts 18 and 98 were constructed; each mutation was predicted to alter or disrupt the local base-parings in the 5' NC RNA structure. An infectious virus was not recovered from the RNA transcripts of five of these deletion mutants. Significantly, four of the five apparently lethal deletions were located in a 5- to 6-nt base-paired region of a predicted long stem or adjacent to it. In contrast, with one exception, mutants which yielded infectious virus had deletions which were located in a loop or short stem region. The effect of the deletions on the efficiency of translation of viral RNA transcripts was examined in vitro. The RNA transcripts of deletion constructs which did not yield viable virus were translated at an efficiency ranging from 40 to 160% that of wild-type virus transcripts. The translation efficiency of infectious RNA transcripts also varied. Deletion mutants recovered from RNA transcripts that exhibited low to moderate efficiency of translation had a small plaque morphology and exhibited reduced growth in simian LLC-MK2 and mosquito C6/36 cells compared to the wild-type virus. Among the 11 mutant constructs, deletion of nts 82-87 caused the greatest reduction in translation efficiency. Nevertheless, an infectious virus was recovered from LLC-MK2 cells transfected with the RNA transcripts of mutant d(82-87).

24776933,2014 Apr 25,A DNA microarray-based assay to detect dual infection with two dengue virus serotypes.,"Here; we have described and tested a microarray based-method for the screening of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. This DNA microarray assay is specific and sensitive and can detect dual infections with two dengue virus serotypes and single-serotype infections. Other methodologies may underestimate samples containing more than one serotype. This technology can be used to discriminate between the four DENV serotypes. Single-stranded DNA targets were covalently attached to glass slides and hybridised with specific labelled probes. DENV isolates and dengue samples were used to evaluate microarray performance. Our results demonstrate that the probes hybridized specifically to DENV serotypes; with no detection of unspecific signals. This finding provides evidence that specific probes can effectively identify single and double infections in DENV samples.

Evidence that dengue viruses have broad circulation in the region, crossing country borders, was also obtained. Whether the outbreak arose from dengue importation from an urban centre into a dengue-naïve community or crossed into the village from a forest cycle is unknown.

27500505,2016 Nov,Rise and fall of vector infectivity during sequential strain displacements by mosquito-borne dengue virus.,"Each of the four serotypes of mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV-1-4) comprises multiple, genetically distinct strains. Competitive displacement between strains within a serotype is a common feature of DENV epidemiology and can trigger outbreaks of dengue disease. We investigated the mechanisms underlying two sequential displacements by DENV-3 strains in Sri Lanka that each coincided with abrupt increases in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence. First, the post-DHF strain displaced the pre-DHF strain in the 1980s. We have previously shown that post-DHF is more infectious than pre-DHF for the major DENV vector, Aedes aegypti. Then, the ultra-DHF strain evolved in situ from post-DHF and displaced its ancestor in the 2000s. We predicted that ultra-DHF would be more infectious for Ae. aegypti than post-DHF but found that ultra-DHF infected a significantly lower percentage of mosquitoes than post-DHF. We therefore hypothesized that ultra-DHF had effected displacement by disseminating in Ae. aegypti more rapidly than post-DHF, but this was not borne out by a time course of mosquito infection. To elucidate the mechanisms that shape these virus-vector interactions, we tested the impact of RNA interference (RNAi), the principal mosquito defence against DENV, on replication of each of the three DENV strains. Replication of all strains was similar in mosquito cells with dysfunctional RNAi, but in cells with functional RNAi, replication of pre-DHF was significantly suppressed relative to the other two strains. Thus, differences in susceptibility to RNAi may account for the differences in mosquito infectivity between pre-DHF and post-DHF, but other mechanisms underlie the difference between post-DHF and ultra-DHF. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology. andradec@gonzaga.edu.

18562532,2008 Sep,A mouse-passaged dengue virus strain with reduced affinity for heparan sulfate causes severe disease in mice by establishing increased systemic viral loads.,"The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1 to DENV4) cause extensive morbidity and mortality. A major obstacle to studying disease pathogenesis and developing therapies has been the lack of a small-animal model. We previously reported isolation of a DENV2 strain, obtained by passaging a clinical isolate between mosquito cells and mice, that caused severe DENV disease in mice and contained multiple mutations, including many in domain II of the envelope (E) protein. Here, we describe a recombinant virus, differing from the non-mouse-passaged virus by two mutations in the E protein, that induces vascular leakage and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated lethality, while the non-mouse-passaged virus causes paralysis. This recombinant virus has a weaker affinity for heparan sulfate, resulting in an increased serum half-life, higher systemic viral loads, and high levels of TNF-alpha in the serum of infected mice. These results exemplify the role of the E protein in modulating virion clearance and connect the effect of clearance on the systemic viral loads responsible for severe disease manifestations. 9420 Athena Circle, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.","['Animals', 'Dengue Virus/classification/genetics/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Heparitin Sulfate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Serotyping', 'Severe Dengue/*blood/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood/pharmacology', '*Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']","['The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1 to DENV4) cause extensive morbidity and mortality.', 'A major obstacle to studying disease pathogenesis and developing therapies has been the lack of a small-animal model.', 'We previously reported isolation of a DENV2 strain, obtained by passaging a clinical isolate between mosquito cells and mice, that caused severe DENV disease in mice and contained multiple mutations, including many in domain II of the envelope (E) protein.', 'Here, we describe a recombinant virus, differing from the non-mouse-passaged virus by two mutations in the E protein, that induces vascular leakage and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated lethality, while the non-mouse-passaged virus causes paralysis.', 'This recombinant virus has a weaker affinity for heparan sulfate, resulting in an increased serum half-life, higher systemic viral loads, and high levels of TNF-alpha in the serum of infected mice.', 'These results exemplify the role of the E protein in modulating virion clearance and connect the effect of clearance on the systemic viral loads responsible for severe disease manifestations.', '9420 Athena Circle, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']"

25022298,2014 Jul 14,Differential replication of dengue virus serotypes 2 and 3 in coinfections of C6/36 cells and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.,"INTRODUCTION: Different dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been associated with greater epidemic potential. In turn, the increased frequency in cases of severe forms of dengue has been associated with the cocirculation of several serotypes. Because Colombia is a country with an endemic presence of all four DENV serotypes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and in vitro replication of the DENV-2 and DENV-3 strains under individual infection and coinfection conditions. METHODOLOGY: C6/36HT cells were infected with the two strains individually or simultaneously (coinfection). Replication capacity was evaluated by RT-qPCR, and the effects on cell viability were assessed with an MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Additionally, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were artificially fed the two strains of each serotype individually or simultaneously. The viral genomes were quantified by RT-qPCR and the survival of the infected mosquitoes was compared to that of uninfected controls. RESULTS: In single infections, three strains significantly affected C6/36HT cell viability, but no significant differences were found in the replication capacities of the strains of the same serotype. In the in vivo infections, mosquito survival was not affected, and no significant differences in replication between strains of the same serotype were found. Finally, in coinfections, serotype 2 replicated with a thousandfold greater efficiency than serotype 3 did both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the cocirculation of serotypes in endemic regions, further studies of coinfections in a natural environment would further an understanding of the transmission dynamics that affect DENV infection epidemiology.

29897042,2018 Jun,"Dengue serosurvey after a 2-month long outbreak in Nîmes, France, 2015: was there more than met the eye?","BackgroundClusters of dengue cases have recently become more frequent in areas of southern France colonised by the vector mosquito Aedes albopictus. In July 2015, a 2-month outbreak of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) was reported in Nîmes. Aim: We conducted a serosurvey in the affected area at the end of the vector activity period to determine the true extent of dengue transmission. Methods: We collected capillary blood from consenting household members, and information on their medical and travel histories, and exposure to mosquito bites. Recent infections were identified using IgM and IgG anti-DENV ELISA, followed, when positive, by plaque reduction neutralisation tests on serum against DENV 1-4 and West Nile virus. The prevalence estimator was calibrated on reference demographic data. We quantified the spatial clustering of dengue cases within the affected community and inferred the transmission tree. Results: The study participation rate was 39% (564/1,431). Three of 564 participants tested positive for DENV-1 infection (after marginal calibration, 0.41%; 95% confidence interval: 0.00-0.84). The spatial analysis showed that cases were clustered at the household level. Most participants perceived the presence of mosquitos as abundant (83%) and reported frequent mosquito bites (57%). We incidentally identified six past West Nile virus infections (0.9%; 95% CI: 0.2-1.6).

18261207,2008 Feb 8,Asymmetric competitive suppression between strains of dengue virus.,"BACKGROUND: Within-host competition between strains of a vector-borne pathogen can affect strain frequencies in both the host and vector, thereby affecting viral population dynamics. However little is known about inter-strain competition in one of the most genetically diverse and epidemiologically important mosquito-borne RNA virus: dengue virus (DENV). To assess the strength and symmetry of intra-host competition among different strains of DENV, the effect of mixed infection of two DENV serotypes, DENV2 and DENV4, on the replication of each in cultured mosquito cells was tested. The number of infectious particles produced by each DENV strain in mixed infections was compared to that in single infections to determine whether replication of each strain was decreased in the presence of the other strain (i.e., competition). The two DENV strains were added to cells either simultaneously (coinfection) or with a 1 or 6-hour time lag between first and second serotype (superinfection). RESULTS: DENV2 and DENV4 showed significantly reduced replication in mixed infection relative to single infection treatments. In superinfection treatments, replication was suppressed to a greater extent when the interval between addition of each strain was longer, and when a strain was added second. Additionally, competitive effects were asymmetric: although both strains replicated to similar peak population sizes in single infections, DENV2 was more suppressed than DENV4 in mixed infections. Superinfection treatments yielded significantly lower combined virus titers than coinfection or single infection treatments. CONCLUSION: Competition between DENV strains in cultured mosquito cells can cause a significant decrease in peak viral population sizes, which could translate to decreased transmission by the vector. Effects of competition were asymmetric between DENV2 and DENV4, probably reflecting significant variation in the competitive ability of DENV strains in nature. Competition was strongest in superinfection treatments, suggesting that colonization of new DENV strains could be impeded in areas where numerous mosquitoes are infected with endemic DENV strains. kpepin@nmsu.edu","['Aedes', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dengue/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']","['BACKGROUND: Within-host competition between strains of a vector-borne pathogen can affect strain frequencies in both the host and vector, thereby affecting viral population dynamics.', 'However little is known about inter-strain competition in one of the most genetically diverse and epidemiologically important mosquito-borne RNA virus: dengue virus (DENV).', 'To assess the strength and symmetry of intra-host competition among different strains of DENV, the effect of mixed infection of two DENV serotypes, DENV2 and DENV4, on the replication of each in cultured mosquito cells was tested.', 'The number of infectious particles produced by each DENV strain in mixed infections was compared to that in single infections to determine whether replication of each strain was decreased in the presence of the other strain (i.e., competition).', 'The two DENV strains were added to cells either simultaneously (coinfection) or with a 1 or 6-hour time lag between first and second serotype (superinfection).', 'RESULTS: DENV2 and DENV4 showed significantly reduced replication in mixed infection relative to single infection treatments.', 'In superinfection treatments, replication was suppressed to a greater extent when the interval between addition of each strain was longer, and when a strain was added second.', 'Additionally, competitive effects were asymmetric: although both strains replicated to similar peak population sizes in single infections, DENV2 was more suppressed than DENV4 in mixed infections.', 'Superinfection treatments yielded significantly lower combined virus titers than coinfection or single infection treatments.', 'CONCLUSION: Competition between DENV strains in cultured mosquito cells can cause a significant decrease in peak viral population sizes, which could translate to decreased transmission by the vector.', 'Effects of competition were asymmetric between DENV2 and DENV4, probably reflecting significant variation in the competitive ability of DENV strains in nature.', 'Competition was strongest in superinfection treatments, suggesting that colonization of new DENV strains could be impeded in areas where numerous mosquitoes are infected with endemic DENV strains.', 'kpepin@nmsu.edu']"
22031935,2012 Jan,Ligand-bound structures of the dengue virus protease reveal the active conformation.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic disease that is a major threat to human health in tropical and subtropical regions. Here we report crystal structures of a peptide covalently bound to dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) protease as well as the serine-protease inhibitor aprotinin bound to the same enzyme. These structures reveal, for the first time, a catalytically active, closed conformation of the DENV protease. In the presence of the peptide, the DENV-3 protease forms the closed conformation in which the hydrophilic β-hairpin region of NS2B wraps around the NS3 protease core, in a manner analogous to the structure of West Nile virus (WNV) protease. Our results confirm that flavivirus proteases form the closed conformation during proteolysis, as previously proposed for WNV. The current DENV-3 protease structures reveal the detailed interactions at the P4' to P3 sites of the substrate. The new structural information explains the sequence preference, particularly for long basic residues in the nonprime side, as well as the difference in substrate specificity between the WNV and DENV proteases at the prime side. Structural analysis of the DENV-3 protease-peptide complex revealed a pocket that is formed by residues from NS2B and NS3; this pocket also exists in the WNV NS2B/NS3 protease structure and could be targeted for potential antivirus development. The structural information presented in the current study is invaluable for the design of specific inhibitors of DENV protease. christian.noble@novartis.com","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallization', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']","['Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic disease that is a major threat to human health in tropical and subtropical regions.', 'Here we report crystal structures of a peptide covalently bound to dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) protease as well as the serine-protease inhibitor aprotinin bound to the same enzyme.', 'These structures reveal, for the first time, a catalytically active, closed conformation of the DENV protease.', 'In the presence of the peptide, the DENV-3 protease forms the closed conformation in which the hydrophilic β-hairpin region of NS2B wraps around the NS3 protease core, in a manner analogous to the structure of West Nile virus (WNV) protease.', 'Our results confirm that flavivirus proteases form the closed conformation during proteolysis, as previously proposed for WNV.', ""The current DENV-3 protease structures reveal the detailed interactions at the P4' to P3 sites of the substrate."", 'The new structural information explains the sequence preference, particularly for long basic residues in the nonprime side, as well as the difference in substrate specificity between the WNV and DENV proteases at the prime side.', 'Structural analysis of the DENV-3 protease-peptide complex revealed a pocket that is formed by residues from NS2B and NS3; this pocket also exists in the WNV NS2B/NS3 protease structure and could be targeted for potential antivirus development.', 'The structural information presented in the current study is invaluable for the design of specific inhibitors of DENV protease.', 'christian.noble@novartis.com']"

In a hyperendemic region during an outbreak, we detected the co-circulation of all Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes including two different genotypes of DENV-3 and DENV-4, and concurrent infections with up to three serotypes were identified in symptomatic patients. A total of 49 acute phase plasma samples from patients clinically suspected of dengue were collected during the 4 weeks of May 2013. DENV-1-4 was detected by reverse transcriptase semi-nested polymerase chain reaction in 33 samples (67.3%), of which 26 DNA fragments were sequenced. Twenty samples (76.9%) were identified with a single DENV serotype and six (23.1%) with more than one serotype. DENV-3 was the predominant serotype of the outbreak. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, DENV-1 isolates belong to genotype V, DENV-2 to American-Asian genotype, DENV-3 to genotypes I and III, and DENV-4 to genotypes I and II.

12634353,2003 Apr,American genotype structures decrease dengue virus output from human monocytes and dendritic cells.,"The dengue virus type 2 structures probably involved in human virulence were previously defined by sequencing the complete genome of both American and Southeast (SE) Asian genotype templates in patient serum (K. C. Leitmeyer et al., J. Virol. 73:4738-4747, 1999). We have now evaluated the effects of introducing a mutation in the envelope glycoprotein (E) gene and/or replacement of 5'- and 3'-nontranslated regions on dengue virus replication in human primary cell cultures. A series of chimeric infectious clones were generated containing different combinations of American and SE Asian genotype sequences. Some of the chimeric viruses had altered plaque morphology in mammalian cells; however, they replicated at similar rates in mosquito cells as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and plaque assay. Although susceptibility to virus infection varied from donor to donor in experiments using human macrophage and dendritic cells, we were able to measure consistent differences in viral RNA output per infected cell. Using this measurement, we demonstrated that the chimeric virus containing the E mutation had a lower virus output compared to the parental infectious clone. A larger reduction in virus output was observed for the triple mutant and the wild-type, American genotype virus from which chimeric inserts were derived. It appears that the three changes function synergistically, although the E mutation alone gives a lower output compared to the 5'- and 3'-terminal mutations. The data suggest that these changes may be responsible for decreased dengue virus replication in human target cells and for virulence characteristics during infection.

In March 2009, DENV-3 was isolated for the second time, occurring about 30 years after the previous circulation. In August, 3 other cases emerged. One much larger outbreak occurred again in 2010. To address the origin and particularly to determine whether the outbreaks were caused by the same viral genotype, we investigated the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the introduction, spread and genetic microevolution of DENV-3 involved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three imported cases (index-1,2,3) separately traveled back from Vietnam, India and Tanzania, resulted in 1, 3 and 60 secondary autochthonous cases, respectively. In autochthonous cases, 64.6% positive in IgM anti-DENV and 18.6% in IgG from a total of 48 submitted serum samples, accompanied by 7 DENV-3 isolates. With 99.8%, 99.7%, and 100% envelope gene nucleotidic identity, 09/GZ/1081 from index-1 and endemic strain (09/GZ/1483) belonged to genotype V; 09/GZ/10616 from index-2 and endemic strains (09/GZ/11144 and 09/GZ/11194) belonged to genotype III Clade-A; and 10/GZ/4898 from index-3 and all four 2010 endemic DENV-3 strains belonged to genotype III Clade-B, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses showed that the 2010 outbreak of dengue was not a reemergence of the 2009 strain. Introductions of different genotypes following more than one route were important contributory factors for the 2009-2010 dengue epidemics/outbreaks in Canton.

33591246,2021 Mar,Effect of low-passage number on dengue consensus genomes and intra-host variant frequencies.,"Intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) have been increasingly used in genomic epidemiology to increase phylogenetic resolution and reconstruct fine-scale outbreak dynamics. These analyses are preferably done on sequence data from direct clinical samples, but in many cases due to low viral loads, there might not be enough genetic material for deep sequencing and iSNV determination. Isolation of the virus from clinical samples with low-passage number increases viral load, but few studies have investigated how dengue virus (DENV) culture isolation from a clinical sample impacts the consensus sequence and the intra-host virus population frequencies. In this study, we investigate consensus and iSNV frequency differences between DENV sequenced directly from clinical samples and their corresponding low-passage isolates. Twenty five DENV1 and DENV2 positive sera and their corresponding viral isolates (T. splendens inoculation and C6/36 passage) were obtained from a prospective cohort study in the Philippines. These were sequenced on MiSeq with minimum nucleotide depth of coverage of 500×, and iSNVs were detected using LoFreq.

22419801,2012 May,The magnitude of dengue virus NS1 protein secretion is strain dependent and does not correlate with severe pathologies in the mouse infection model.,"There are conflicting data on the relationship between the level of secreted NS1 (sNS1), viremia, and disease severity upon dengue virus (DENV) infection in the clinical setting, and therefore, we examined this relationship in the widely accepted AG129 mouse model. Because of the failure of a routinely used NS1 detection kit to detect sNS1 of the mouse-adapted DENV2 strain, we screened 15 previously undescribed NS1 monoclonal antibodies and developed a robust capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with detection sensitivity at the low nanogram level (0.2 ng/ml) using recombinant baculovirus-expressed sNS1 as well as sNS1 that was immunoaffinity purified from the various DENV2 strains employed in this study. Using this test, we demonstrated that increased viremia paralleled severe pathologies; however, sNS1 level did not correlate with viremia or severity. Furthermore, among the DENV2 strains that were tested, the level of NS1 secretion did not correspond to virus replication rate in vitro, at the cellular level. Together, our data indicate that the magnitude of NS1 secretion appears to be strain dependent and does not correlate with viral virulence in the AG129 mouse model.

25775415,2015 Mar,A crystal structure of the Dengue virus NS5 protein reveals a novel inter-domain interface essential for protein flexibility and virus replication.,"Flavivirus RNA replication occurs within a replication complex (RC) that assembles on ER membranes and comprises both non-structural (NS) viral proteins and host cofactors. As the largest protein component within the flavivirus RC, NS5 plays key enzymatic roles through its N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) and C-terminal RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, and constitutes a major target for antivirals. We determined a crystal structure of the full-length NS5 protein from Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) at a resolution of 2.3 Å in the presence of bound SAH and GTP. Although the overall molecular shape of NS5 from DENV3 resembles that of NS5 from Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), the relative orientation between the MTase and RdRp domains differs between the two structures, providing direct evidence for the existence of a set of discrete stable molecular conformations that may be required for its function. While the inter-domain region is mostly disordered in NS5 from JEV, the NS5 structure from DENV3 reveals a well-ordered linker region comprising a short 310 helix that may act as a swivel. Solution Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis reveals an increased mobility of the thumb subdomain of RdRp in the context of the full length NS5 protein which correlates well with the analysis of the crystallographic temperature factors. Site-directed mutagenesis targeting the mostly polar interface between the MTase and RdRp domains identified several evolutionarily conserved residues that are important for viral replication, suggesting that inter-domain cross-talk in NS5 regulates virus replication. Collectively, a picture for the molecular origin of NS5 flexibility is emerging with profound implications for flavivirus replication and for the development of therapeutics targeting NS5.

22439913,2012 Mar 22,A tetravalent dengue nanoparticle stimulates antibody production in mice.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection with a single Dengue virus (DENV) serotype causes a mild, self-limiting febrile illness called dengue fever. However, a subset of patients experiencing secondary infection with a different serotype progresses to the severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat dengue infections. Biodegradable nanoparticles coated with proteins represent a promising method for in vivo delivery of vaccines. FINDINGS: Here, we used a murine model to evaluate the IgG production after administration of inactivated DENV corresponding to all four serotypes adsorbed to bovine serum albumin nanoparticles. This formulation induced a production of anti-DENV IgG antibodies (p < 0.001). However, plaque reduction neutralization assays with the four DENV serotypes revealed that these antibodies have no neutralizing activity in the dilutions tested. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that while the nanoparticle system induces humoral responses against DENV, further investigation with different DENV antigens will be required to improve immunogenicity, epitope specicity, and functional activity to make this platform a viable option for DENV vaccines.

26072288,2015 Oct,Membrane topology of NS2B of dengue virus revealed by NMR spectroscopy.,"Non-structural (NS) proteins of dengue virus (DENV) are important for viral replication. There are four membrane proteins that are coded by viral genome. NS2B was shown to be one of the membrane proteins and its main function was confirmed to regulate viral protease activity. Its membrane topology is still not known because only few studies have been conducted to understand its structure. Here we report the determination of membrane topology of NS2B from DENV serotype 4 using NMR spectroscopy. NS2B of DENV4 was expressed and purified in detergent micelles. The secondary structure of NS2B was first defined based on backbone chemical resonance assignment. Four helices were identified in NS2B. The membrane topology of NS2B was defined based on relaxation analysis and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments. The last three helices were shown to be more stable than the first helix. The NS3 protease cofactor region between α2 and α3 is highly dynamic. Our results will be useful for further structural and functional analysis of NS2B.

29377886,2018 Jan,"Molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses in three provinces of Lao PDR, 2006-2010.","Few data on dengue epidemiology are available for Lao PDR. Here, we provide information on the complexity of dengue epidemiology in the country, demonstrating dynamic circulation that varies over space and time, according to serotype. We recruited 1,912 consenting patients presenting with WHO dengue criteria at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane (central Laos), between 2006 and 2010. Between 2008 and 2010, 1,413 patients with undifferentiated fever were also recruited at Luang Namtha (LNT) Provincial Hospital (northern Laos) and 555 at Salavan (SV) Provincial Hospital (southern Laos). We report significant variations in Dengue virus (DENV) circulation between the three sites. Peaks of DENV infection were observed in the rainy seasons, although 11% of confirmed cases in the provinces and 4.6% in the capital were detected during the dry and cool seasons (between December and February). Four DENV serotypes were detected among the 867 RT-PCR positive patients: 76.9% DENV-1, 9.6% DENV-2, 7.7% DENV-4 and 5.3% DENV-3. DENV-1 was the predominant serotype throughout the study except in LNT in 2008 and 2009 when it was DENV-2. Before July 2009, DENV-2 was not detected in SV and only rarely detected in Vientiane. DENV-3 and DENV-4 were commonly detected in Vientiane, before 2008 for DENV-4 and after 2009 for DENV-3. The phylogenetic analyses of DENV envelope sequences suggest concurrent multiple introductions of new strains as well as active DENV circulation throughout Laos and with neighboring countries. It is therefore of great importance to develop and strengthen a year-round nation-wide surveillance network in order to collect data that would allow anticipation of public health issues caused by the occurrence of large dengue outbreaks.

19656873,2009 Oct,Passage of dengue virus type 4 vaccine candidates in fetal rhesus lung cells selects heparin-sensitive variants that result in loss of infectivity and immunogenicity in rhesus macaques.,"Three dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' noncoding region were prepared by passage in DBS-FRhL-2 (FRhL) cells. Unexpectedly, these vaccine candidates and parental DENV-4 similarly passaged in the same cells failed to elicit either viremia or a virus-neutralizing antibody response. Consensus sequence analysis revealed that each of the three viruses, as well as the parental DENV-4 when passaged in FRhL cells, rapidly acquired a single Glu327-Gly substitution in domain III (DIII) of the envelope protein (E). These variants appear to have accumulated in response to growth adaptation to FRhL cells as shown by growth analysis, and the mutation was not detected in the virus following passage in C6/36 cells, primary African green monkey kidney cells, or Vero cells. The Glu327-Gly substitution was predicted by molecular modeling to increase the net positive charge on the surface of E. The Glu(327)-Gly variant of the full-length DENV-4 selected after three passages in FRhL cells showed increased affinity for heparan sulfate compared to the unpassaged DENV-4, as measured by heparin binding and infectivity inhibition assays. Evidence indicates that the Glu327-Gly mutation in DIII of the DENV-4 E protein was responsible for reduced infectivity and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys. Our results point out the importance of cell substrates for vaccine preparation since the virus may change during passages in certain cells through adaptive selection, and such mutations may affect cell tropism, virulence, and vaccine efficacy.

21906394,2011 Sep 10,Serotype and genotype analysis of dengue virus by sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis using samples from three mini outbreaks-2007-2009 in Pakistan.,"BACKGROUND: Since the first reported outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan, several mini outbreaks have erupted in the region. Dengue virus serotype 3 (DEN-3) was first documented in 2005 outbreak in Karachi. Reports show that serotype 3 is prevalent in Lahore since 2008. Serotype 2 (DEN-2) is the major circulating serotype in Pakistan as it is documented since 1994. We have conducted a detailed study of three outbreaks of dengue virus infection that occurred in years 2007, 2008 and 2009 in Lahore by using molecular techniques such as PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the C-prM gene junction of Dengue virus. RESULTS: Through the analysis of 114 serum samples collected over the period of three years (2007-2009), total 20 patients were found to be infected with dengue virus. In year 2007, four were positive for serotype 2 and one sample was positive for serotype DEN-3. In 2008, five samples had concurrent infection with serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-3 while three samples were infected only with serotype DEN-2. In year 2009, one sample had concurrent infection with serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-3 while six were positive for serotype DEN-2 only.

23175363,2013 Feb,Inhibition of cellular autophagy deranges dengue virion maturation.,"Autophagy is an important component of the innate immune response, directly destroying many intracellular pathogens. However, some pathogens, including several RNA viruses, subvert the autophagy pathway, or components of the pathway, to facilitate their replication. In the present study, the effect of inhibiting autophagy on the growth of dengue virus was tested using a novel inhibitor, spautin-1 (specific and potent autophagy inhibitor 1). Inhibition of autophagy by spautin-1 generated heat-sensitive, noninfectious dengue virus particles, revealing a large effect of components of the autophagy pathway on viral maturation. A smaller effect on viral RNA accumulation was also observed. Conversely, stimulation of autophagy resulted in increased viral titers and pathogenicity in the mouse. We conclude that the presence of functional autophagy components facilitates viral RNA replication and, more importantly, is required for infectious dengue virus production. Pharmacological inhibition of host processes is an attractive antiviral strategy to avoid selection of treatment-resistant variants, and inhibitors of autophagy may prove to be valuable therapeutics against dengue virus infection and pathogenesis.

15613349,2005 Jan,Variable surface epitopes in the crystal structure of dengue virus type 3 envelope glycoprotein.,"Dengue virus is an emerging global health threat. The major envelope glycoprotein, E, mediates viral attachment and entry by membrane fusion. Antibodies that bind but fail to neutralize noncognate serotypes enhance infection. We have determined the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of the envelope glycoprotein E from dengue virus type 3. The structure closely resembles those of E proteins from dengue type 2 and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Serotype-specific neutralization escape mutants in dengue virus E proteins are all located on a surface of domain III, which has been implicated in receptor binding. While antibodies against epitopes in domain I are nonneutralizing in dengue virus, there are neutralizing antibodies that recognize serotype-conserved epitopes in domain II. The mechanism of neutralization for these antibodies is probably inhibition of membrane fusion. Our structure shows that neighboring glycans on the viral surface are spaced widely enough (at least 32 A) that they can interact with multiple carbohydrate recognition domains on oligomeric lectins such as DC-SIGN, ensuring maximum affinity for these putative receptors.","['Crystallization', 'Dengue Virus/*chemistry/classification', 'Dimerization', 'Epitopes', 'Protein Conformation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/immunology']","['Dengue virus is an emerging global health threat.', 'The major envelope glycoprotein, E, mediates viral attachment and entry by membrane fusion.', 'Antibodies that bind but fail to neutralize noncognate serotypes enhance infection.', 'We have determined the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of the envelope glycoprotein E from dengue virus type 3.', 'The structure closely resembles those of E proteins from dengue type 2 and tick-borne encephalitis viruses.', 'Serotype-specific neutralization escape mutants in dengue virus E proteins are all located on a surface of domain III, which has been implicated in receptor binding.', 'While antibodies against epitopes in domain I are nonneutralizing in dengue virus, there are neutralizing antibodies that recognize serotype-conserved epitopes in domain II.', 'The mechanism of neutralization for these antibodies is probably inhibition of membrane fusion.', 'Our structure shows that neighboring glycans on the viral surface are spaced widely enough (at least 32 A) that they can interact with multiple carbohydrate recognition domains on oligomeric lectins such as DC-SIGN, ensuring maximum affinity for these putative receptors.']"
12202213,2002 Aug 15,Genetic basis of attenuation of dengue virus type 4 small plaque mutants with restricted replication in suckling mice and in SCID mice transplanted with human liver cells.,"Mutations that restrict replication of dengue virus have been sought for the generation of recombinant live-attenuated dengue virus vaccines. Dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) was previously grown in Vero cells in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, and the characterization of 1248 mutagenized, Vero cell passaged clones identified 20 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant viruses that were attenuated (att) in suckling mouse brain (J. E. Blaney, Jr., D. H. Johnson, C. Y. Firestone, C. T. Hanson, B. R. Murphy, and S. S. Whitehead, 2001, J. Virol. 75(20), 9731-9740). The present investigation has extended these studies by identifying an additional 22 DEN4 mutant viruses which have a small plaque size (sp) phenotype in Vero cells and/or the liver cell line, HuH-7. Five mutant viruses have a sp phenotype in both Vero and HuH-7 cells, three of which are also ts. Seventeen mutant viruses have a sp phenotype in only HuH-7 cells, 13 of which are also ts. Each of the sp viruses was growth restricted in the suckling mouse brain, exhibiting a wide range of reduction in replication (9- to 100,000-fold). Complete nucleotide sequence was determined for the 22 DEN4 sp mutant viruses, and nucleotide substitutions were found in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) as well as in all coding regions except NS4A. Identical mutations have been identified in multiple virus clones, suggesting that they may be involved in the adaptation of DEN4 virus to efficient growth in Vero cells. Six of the 22 sp 5-FU mutant viruses lacked coding mutations in the structural genes, and 17 recombinant DEN4 viruses were generated which separately encoded each of the mutations observed in these six sp viruses. Analysis of the recombinant DEN4 viruses defined the genetic basis of the sp, ts, and att phenotypes observed in the six sp viruses. Mutations in NS1, NS3, and the 3'-UTR were found to confer a greater than 100-fold, 10,000-fold, and 1000-fold reduction in replication of rDEN4 virus in SCID mice transplanted with HuH-7 cells, respectively, which serves as a novel small animal model for DEN4 infection.

25311698,2014 Dec,Experimental inoculation of Artibeus jamaicensis bats with dengue virus serotypes 1 or 4 showed no evidence of sustained replication.,"Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Bats are potential reservoirs for flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV). In this work, Artibeus jamaicensis bats were inoculated with two serotypes of DENV using different routes. For experimental inoculations (EI) 1 and 2, bats were inoculated subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with DENV-4; for EI-3 bats were inoculated intraperitoneally with DENV-1. Mock inoculated bats were kept as controls. In EI-4, bats were bitten by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with DENV-1 or 4. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays in plasma and spleen tissue collected from Day 1 to Days 9-17 after inoculation failed to reveal the presence of viral RNA in any of the samples. No evidence of circulating NS1 or specific anti-DENV IgG was detected in the plasma of the inoculated bats. These results indicate that A. jamaicensis bats are incapable of sustaining dengue virus replication and are unlikely to act as reservoirs for this virus.

16469696,2006 Feb 10,Cryo-EM reconstruction of dengue virus in complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain of DC-SIGN.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant human pathogen that causes millions of infections and results in about 24,000 deaths each year. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), abundant in immature dendritic cells, was previously reported as being an ancillary receptor interacting with the surface of DENV. The structure of DENV in complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN was determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 25 A resolution. One CRD monomer was found to bind to two glycosylation sites at Asn67 of two neighboring glycoproteins in each icosahedral asymmetric unit, leaving the third Asn67 residue vacant. The vacancy at the third Asn67 site is a result of the nonequivalence of the glycoprotein environments, leaving space for the primary receptor binding to domain III of E. The use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites suggests a mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance.

27139442,2016 Jul 6,Molecular Characterization of Two Major Dengue Outbreaks in Costa Rica.,"Dengue virus (DENV) (Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is a reemerging arthropod-borne virus with a worldwide circulation, transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Since the first detection of its main transmitting vector in 1992 and the invasion of DENV-1 in 1993, Costa Rica has faced dengue outbreaks yearly. In 2007 and 2013, Costa Rica experienced two of the largest outbreaks in terms of total and severe cases. To provide genetic information about the etiologic agents producing these outbreaks, we conducted phylogenetic analysis of viruses isolated from human samples. A total of 23 DENV-1 and DENV-2 sequences were characterized. These analyses signaled that DENV-1 genotype V and DENV-2 American/Asian genotype were circulating in those outbreaks. Our results suggest that the 2007 and 2013 outbreak viral strains of DENV-1 and DENV-2 originated from nearby countries and underwent in situ microevolution.

METHODS: A total of 93 cleft lip and palate patients between the age of 6-11 year-old and treated at West China Stomatology Hospital were selected. And another 100 unaffected controls, matched for age and gender, were recruited randomly from a common primary school in Chengdu. Chart review of medical records was used to obtain psychosocial checklists. Scores were compared with published norms and controls to evaluate the risk of problems, separately for three diagnostic groups. RESULTS: The patients group had lower scores of social and academic competencies, especially those with facial deformity or speech problem. No difference was found in the aspect of activity competency. All patients showed elevations in behavior problems. But the type of behavior problems varied in different genders. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese school-aged children with cleft lip and palate are at raised risk for social and academic difficulties.

24684835,2014 Mar 31,"Epidemiological and molecular features of dengue virus type-1 in New Caledonia, South Pacific, 2001-2013.","BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of dengue in the South Pacific has been characterized by transmission of a single dominant serotype for 3-5 years, with subsequent replacement by another serotype. From 2001 to 2008 only DENV-1 was reported in the Pacific. In 2008, DENV-4 emerged and quickly displaced DENV-1 in the Pacific, except in New Caledonia (NC) where DENV-1 and DENV-4 co-circulated in 2008-2009. During 2012-2013, another DENV-1 outbreak occurred in NC, the third DENV-1 outbreak in a decade. Given that dengue is a serotype-specific immunizing infection, the recurrent outbreaks of a single serotype within a 10-year period was unexpected. FINDINGS: This study aimed to inform this phenomenon by examining the phylogenetic characteristics of the DENV-1 viruses in NC and other Pacific islands between 2001 and 2013. As a result, we have demonstrated that NC experienced introductions of viruses from both the Pacific (genotype IV) and South-east Asia (genotype I). Moreover, whereas genotype IV and I were co-circulating at the beginning of 2012, we observed that from the second half of 2012, i.e. during the major DENV-1 outbreak, all analyzed viruses were genotype I suggesting that a genotype switch occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated outbreaks of the same dengue serotype, as observed in NC, is uncommon in the Pacific islands. Why the earlier DENV-1 outbreaks did not induce sufficient herd immunity is unclear, and likely multifactorial, but the robust vector control program may have played a role by limiting transmission and thus maintaining a large susceptible pool in the population.

22579629,2012 Jul,Detection and typing of viruses using broadly sensitive cocktail-PCR and mass spectrometric cataloging: demonstration with dengue virus.,"Virus detection and taxonomic identification of serotypes, strains, or genotypes provide important information relevant for diagnosis, and for the epidemiological characterization and tracking of new strains in an endemic region. In the specific case of dengue virus, rapid serotype identification can also be useful in the treatment of secondary infections that may cause the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. In this work, dengue virus was used as a model to test a new approach of combining broadly sensitive RT-PCR amplification of nearly any virus strain with subsequent serotype- and finer-level identification by mass spectrometry. PCR primers were appended with promoter sequences, such that the resulting PCR products could be transcribed into RNA. RNA fragments generated by guanosine-specific RNase T(1) digestion were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Viral serotypes were identified by comparing the pattern of observed fragment masses to a mass database. The database was created by computationally fragmenting 2517 dengue strains after each guanosine residue using the same primers. Computationally, all 2517 strains in the mass database were correctly identified at the serotype level from the predicted PCR product. The methodology was successfully demonstrated experimentally by identifying the serotypes of eight test strains using mosquito cell cultures infected with strains of all four serotypes and with full-length cDNA clones. for Molecular Pathology.

25724189,2015 Jun,A Multiplexed Cell-Based Assay for the Identification of Modulators of Pre-Membrane Processing as a Target against Dengue Virus.,"The DenV pre-membrane protein (prM) is a crucial chaperone for the viral envelope protein, preventing premature fusion with vesicles during viral export. prM molecules in immature particles are cleaved by host proteases, leading to mature fusogenic virions. Blockade of prM cleavage would restrict fusion and represents a novel druggable opportunity against DenV. We have thus established a cell-based platform to monitor prM processing that relies on an engineered two-tag scaffold that travels to the cell surface through the secretory pathway. The assay discriminates between a single cell-surface tag when prM is cleaved and two tags when it is not, as detected through fluorescent-coupled antibodies by flow cytometry. The assay, miniaturized into a 96-well plate format, was multiplexed with the HIV-1 envelope boundary, also cleaved in the same pathway. A pilot screen against 1280 compounds was executed, leading to the identification of a potential active and corroborating the robustness of our assay for large-scale screening.

19523154,2009 Oct,Alternative infectious entry pathways for dengue virus serotypes into mammalian cells.,"The entry of two dengue virus (DENV) serotypes into Vero cells was analysed using biochemical inhibitors, dominant negative mutants of cellular proteins involved in endocytic pathways, fluorescence microscopy and infectivity determinations. By treatment with dansylcadaverine and chlorpromazine and overexpression of a dominant negative form of the Eps15 protein, a clathrin-mediated endocytosis for productive DENV-1 internalization into Vero cells was demonstrated whereas the infectious entry of DENV-2 in the same cell system was independent of clathrin. Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, as well as transfection of Vero cells with dominant negative caveolin-1, had no effect on DENV-2 virus infection. It was also shown, by using the K44A mutant and the inhibitor dynasore, that dynamin was required for DENV-2 entry. Consequently, the infectious entry of DENV-2 into Vero cells occurs by a non-classical endocytic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolae and lipid rafts, but dependent on dynamin. By contrast, DENV-2 entry into A549 cells was clathrin-dependent, as previously reported in HeLa, C6/36 and BS-C-1 cells.

20219924,2010 May,Both E protein glycans adversely affect dengue virus infectivity but are beneficial for virion release.,"The E protein of most flaviviruses is modified by Asn-linked glycosylation at residue 153/154 and in the case of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes by a second glycan at residue 67. However, the absence of E protein glycosylation among numerous natural isolates of different flaviviruses suggests that the glycan, per se, is not critically important in the virus life cycle. Consistent with this notion, we show that ablation of both glycans from the DENV-2 E protein reduces but does not prevent growth of the variant in mammalian and mosquito cells. We found a pronounced and opposing effect of glycan ablation on two stages of the virus growth cycle: infectivity and release. Loss of either of the two DENV E protein glycans markedly enhanced infectivity of variants for mosquito cells at the expense of efficient virion release. The variants also displayed reduced release in mammalian cells, which was more prominent for viruses lacking the Asn 67-linked glycan than for those lacking the Asn 153-linked glycan, without a marked change in infectivity. Mutations, which compensated for the defect in virus morphogenesis associated with ablation of the Asn 67-linked glycan in mammalian cells but interestingly not in mosquito cells, were identified at the glycosylation acceptor motif and a second site in E protein domain II. The dueling influences of infectivity and release on virus growth affected by the glycans may explain the plasticity in E protein glycosylation among the flaviviruses.

29211244,2017 Dec,Dengue serotype-specific immune response in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue viruses (DENV) are considered one of the most important emerging pathogens and dengue disease is a global health threat. The geographic expansion of dengue viruses has led to co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes making it imperative that new DENV control strategies be devised. OBJECTIVES: Here we characterize dengue serotype-specific innate immune responses in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus using DENV from Puerto Rico (PR). METHODS: Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were infected with dengue serotype 1 and 2 isolated from Puerto Rico. DENV infected mosquito samples were collected and temporal change in expression of selected innate immune response pathway genes analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. FINDINGS: The Toll pathway is involved in anti-dengue response in Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus. Infections with PR DENV- 1 elicited a stronger response from genes of the Toll immune pathway than PR DENV-2 in Ae. aegypti but in infected Ae. albopictus expression of Toll pathway genes tended to be similar between the serotypes. Two genes (a ribosomal S5 protein gene and a nimrod-like gene) from Ae. albopictus were expressed in response to DENV. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These studies revealed a role for antiviral genes in DENV serotype-specific interactions with DENV vectors, demonstrated that infections with DENV-2 can modulate the Toll immune response pathway in Ae. aegypti and elucidated candidate molecules that might be used to interfere with serotype specific vector-virus interactions.

22216313,2011,Recent emergence of dengue virus serotype 4 in French Polynesia results from multiple introductions from other South Pacific Islands.,"BACKGROUND: Infection by dengue virus (DENV) is a major public health concern in hundreds of tropical and subtropical countries. French Polynesia (FP) regularly experiences epidemics that initiate, or are consecutive to, DENV circulation in other South Pacific Island Countries (SPICs). In January 2009, after a decade of serotype 1 (DENV-1) circulation, the first cases of DENV-4 infection were reported in FP. Two months later a new epidemic emerged, occurring about 20 years after the previous circulation of DENV-4 in FP. In this study, we investigated the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the introduction, spread and genetic microevolution of DENV-4 in FP. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Epidemiological data suggested that recent transmission of DENV-4 in FP started in the Leeward Islands and this serotype quickly displaced DENV-1 throughout FP. Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the envelope (E) gene of 64 DENV-4 strains collected in FP in the 1980s and in 2009-2010, and some additional strains from other SPICs showed that DENV-4 strains from the SPICs were distributed into genotypes IIa and IIb. Recent FP strains were distributed into two clusters, each comprising viruses from other but distinct SPICs, suggesting that emergence of DENV-4 in FP in 2009 resulted from multiple introductions. Otherwise, we observed that almost all strains collected in the SPICs in the 1980s exhibit an amino acid (aa) substitution V287I within domain I of the E protein, and all recent South Pacific strains exhibit a T365I substitution within domain III. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirmed the cyclic re-emergence and displacement of DENV serotypes in FP. Otherwise, our results showed that specific aa substitutions on the E protein were present on all DENV-4 strains circulating in SPICs. These substitutions probably acquired and subsequently conserved could reflect a founder effect to be associated with epidemiological, geographical, eco-biological and social specificities in SPICs.

23875046,2013,Analytical and clinical performance of the CDC real time RT-PCR assay for detection and typing of dengue virus.,"Dengue is an acute illness caused by the positive-strand RNA dengue virus (DENV). There are four genetically distinct DENVs (DENV-1-4) that cause disease in tropical and subtropical countries. Most patients are viremic when they present with symptoms; therefore, RT-PCR has been increasingly used in dengue diagnosis. The CDC DENV-1-4 RT-PCR Assay has been developed as an in-vitro diagnostic platform and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for detection of dengue in patients with signs or symptoms of mild or severe dengue. The primers and probes of this test have been designed to detect currently circulating strains of DENV-1-4 from around the world at comparable sensitivity. In a retrospective study with 102 dengue cases confirmed by IgM anti-DENV seroconversion in the convalescent sample, the RT-PCR Assay detected DENV RNA in 98.04% of the paired acute samples. Using sequencing as a positive indicator, the RT-PCR Assay had a 97.92% positive agreement in 86 suspected dengue patients with a single acute serum sample. After extensive validations, the RT-PCR Assay performance was highly reproducible when evaluated across three independent testing sites, did not produce false positive results for etiologic agents of other febrile illnesses, and was not affected by pathological levels of potentially interfering biomolecules. These results indicate that the CDC DENV-1-4 RT-PCR Assay provides a reliable diagnostic platform capable for confirming dengue in suspected cases.

25784569,2015 Jun,"Genomic analysis and growth characteristic of dengue viruses from Makassar, Indonesia.","Dengue fever is currently the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in Indonesia. In South Sulawesi province, most regions report dengue cases including the capital city, Makassar. Currently, no information is available on the serotypes and genotypes of the viruses circulating in the area. To understand the dynamic of dengue disease in Makassar, we carried out dengue fever surveillance study during 2007-2010. A total of 455 patients were recruited, in which antigen and serological detection revealed the confirmed dengue cases in 43.3% of patients. Molecular detection confirmed the dengue cases in 27.7% of patients, demonstrating that dengue places a significant disease burden on the community. Serotyping revealed that dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) was the most predominant serotype, followed by DENV-2, -3, and -4. To determine the molecular evolution of the viruses, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of 80 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis grouped DENV-2, -3 and -4 to the Cosmopolitan genotype, Genotype I and Genotype II, respectively. Intriguingly, each serotype paints a different picture of evolution and transmission. DENV-1 appears to be undergoing a clade replacement with Genotype IV being supplanted by Genotype I. The Cosmopolitan DENV-2 isolates were found to be regionally endemic and is frequently being exchanged between countries in the region. By contrast, DENV-3 and DENV-4 isolates were related to strains with a long history in Indonesia although the DENV-3 strains appear to have been following a distinct evolutionary path since approximately 1998. To assess whether the various DENV serotypes/genotypes possess different growth characteristics, we performed growth kinetic assays on selected viruses. We observed the relatively higher rate of replication for DENV-1 and -2 compared to DENV-3 and -4. Within the DENV-1, viruses from Genotype I grow faster than that of Genotype IV. This higher replication rate may underlie their ability to replace the circulation of Genotype IV in the community. Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jl.

23533624,2013,"Circulation of different lineages of Dengue virus 2, genotype American/Asian in Brazil: dynamics and molecular and phylogenetic characterization.","The American/Asian genotype of Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) was introduced into the Americas in the 80's. Although there is no data showing when this genotype was first introduced into Brazil, it was first detected in Brazil in 1990. After which the virus spread throughout the country and major epidemics occurred in 1998, 2007/08 and 2010. In this study we sequenced 12 DENV-2 genomes obtained from serum samples of patients with dengue fever residing in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo (SJRP/SP), Brazil, in 2008. The whole open reading frame or envelope sequences were used to perform phylogenetic, phylogeographic and evolutionary analyses. Isolates from SJRP/SP were grouped within one lineage (BR3) close to isolates from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Isolates from SJRP were probably introduced there at least in 2007, prior to its detection in the 2008 outbreak. DENV-2 circulation in Brazil is characterized by the introduction, displacement and circulation of three well-defined lineages in different times, most probably from the Caribbean. Thirty-seven unique amino acid substitutions were observed among the lineages, including seven amino acid differences in domains I to III of the envelope protein. Moreover, we dated here, for the first time, the introduction of American/Asian genotype into Brazil (lineage BR1) to 1988/89, followed by the introduction of lineages BR2 (1998-2000) and BR3 (2003-05). Our results show a delay between the introduction and detection of DENV-2 lineages in Brazil, reinforcing the importance and need for surveillance programs to detect and trace the evolution of these viruses.

A set of group- and serotype-specific primer pairs was designed against conserved sequences in the core region and evaluated for clinical diagnosis. A linear relationship was obtained between the amount of input RNA and cycle threshold (Ct) value over a range of 10 to 10(7) PFU per ml of cell culture-derived dengue viruses. The detection limit of the group-specific primer pair was between 4.1 and 43.5 PFU/ml for four dengue serotypes. The detection limit of each of the serotype-specific primer pairs was calculated to be 10 PFU/ml for dengue virus serotype 1 (DEN-1), 4.6 PFU/ml for DEN-2, 4.1 PFU/ml for DEN-3, and 5 PFU/ml for DEN-4. Comparisons between the one-step SYBR Green-based RT-PCR assay and the conventional cell culture method in the clinical diagnosis of dengue virus infection from acute-phase serum samples of confirmed dengue patients were performed. The results showed that 83 and 67% of 193 acute-phase serum samples tested were positive by the one-step SYBR Green-based RT-PCR method and cell culture method, respectively.

This study aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics of this large outbreak in order to better understand its epidemic factors and to inform control strategies. METHODS: Data for clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed dengue fever cases in 2014 were extracted from the China Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System. We analyzed the incidence and characteristics of imported and indigenous cases in terms of population, temporal and spatial distributions. RESULTS: A total of 45 224 dengue fever cases and 6 deaths were notified in Guangdong Province in 2014, with an incidence of 47.3 per 100 000 people. The elderly (65+ years) represented 11.7 % of total indigenous cases with the highest incidence (72.3 per 100 000). Household workers and the unemployed accounted for 23.1 % of indigenous cases. The majority of indigenous cases occurred in the 37(th) to 44(th) week of 2014 (September and October) and almost all (20 of 21) prefecture-level cities in Guangdong were affected. Compared to the non-Pearl River Delta Region, the Pearl River Delta Region accounted for the majority of dengue cases and reported cases earlier in 2014. Dengue virus serotypes 1 (DENV-1), 2 (DENV-2) and 3 (DENV-3) were detected and DENV-1 was predominant (88.4 %).

DENV NS1 displays two conserved N-linked glycans at N130 and N207. In this study, we examined the role of these two N-linked glycans on NS1 secretion, stability, and function. Because some groups have reported reduced yields of infectious DENV when N130 and N207 are changed, we analyzed glycosylation-deficient NS1 phenotypes using a transgenic expression system. We show that the N-linked glycan at position 130 is required for stabilization of the secreted hexamer whereas the N-linked glycan at residue 207 facilitates secretion and extracellular protein stability. Moreover, NS1 mutants lacking an N-linked glycan at N130 did not interact efficiently with complement components C1s and C4.

25187539,2014 Nov,Increased replicative fitness of a dengue virus 2 clade in native mosquitoes: potential contribution to a clade replacement event in Nicaragua.,"The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV serotype 1 [DENV-1] to DENV-4) are transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes, causing up to 390 million DENV infections worldwide each year. We previously reported a clade replacement of the DENV-2 Asian-American genotype NI-1 clade by the NI-2B clade in Managua, Nicaragua. Here, we describe our studies of the replicative ability of NI-1 and NI-2B viruses in an A. aegypti cell line (Aag2) and A. aegypti mosquitoes reared from eggs collected in Managua. In coinfection experiments, several different pairs of NI-1 and NI-2B clinical isolates were used to infect Aag2 cells or blood-fed A. aegypti mosquitoes. Results consistently showed a significant replicative advantage of NI-2B over NI-1 viruses early after infection in vitro, and in mosquitoes, NI-2B viruses attained a higher replicative index than NI-1 isolates 3 to 7 days postinfection (dpi). At 7 dpi, NI-2B viruses displayed a significantly higher replicative index in legs and salivary glands; however, this advantage was lost by 14 and 21 dpi. We also found that the percentage of mosquitoes in which NI-2B viruses were dominant was significantly higher than that in which NI-1 viruses were dominant on day 7 but not at later time points. Taken together, these data demonstrate that clade NI-2B holds a replicative advantage over clade NI-1 early in infection that wanes at later time points. This early fitness advantage of NI-2B viruses over NI-1 viruses in the native vector, A. aegypti, suggests a shorter extrinsic incubation period for NI-2B viruses, which could have contributed to the clade replacement event in Managua. IMPORTANCE: Dengue virus (DENV), one of the most medically important arthropod-borne viruses, is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Dengue epidemics continue to increase in frequency, geographic range, and severity and are a major public health concern. This is due to globalization, unplanned urbanization, and climate change, as well as host genetics and immune responses and viral genetic changes. DENV consists of four serotypes, in turn composed of genotypes and genetically distinct clades. What drives the frequent replacement of a previously circulating DENV clade by another is unclear. Here, we investigate the replicative fitness of two clades of DENV serotype 2 in Aedes aegypti cells and mosquitoes collected from the region where the viruses circulated and conclude that increased replicative fitness could have contributed to a DENV clade replacement event in Nicaragua.

27393681,2016 Oct,A Luminex-based single DNA fragment amplification assay as a practical tool for detecting and serotyping dengue virus.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that can evolve from subclinical to severe forms of disease. Early recognition during initial primary and secondary infections correlates with a reduced case-fatality rate in susceptible groups. The aim of this study was to standardize a DNA hybridization assay based on the Luminex technology for detecting and serotyping dengue virus (DENV). Reference DENVs representing the four different serotypes were used as controls to standardize the test. For validation, 16 DENV isolates obtained from a reference laboratory were analyzed in a double-blind manner to validate the test. Sixty blood samples from patients suspected of having dengue fever were used to evaluate the methodology after the validation step, and the results were compared with the reference semi-nested RT-PCR. Additionally, five human samples of each Zika and Chikungunya confirmed patients were used for specificity analysis. The Luminex-based assay correctly identified all 16 DENV isolates. In the evaluation step, the results of the RT-PCR/Luminex assay showed a concordance of 86.7% with those of the semi-nested RT-PCR. None of other virus infection samples was amplified. This is the first description of a hybridization assay that can discriminate the four DENV serotypes using probes against a single DENV sequence. The results indicated that the RT-PCR/Luminex DENV assay designed and evaluated in this study is a valuable additional tool for the early and rapid detection and serotyping of DENV, which could, in the future, be applied to new targets such as the Zika and Chikungunya viruses.

18764951,2008 Sep 2,Simultaneous circulation of genotypes I and III of dengue virus 3 in Colombia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. In Colombia, dengue viruses (DENV) cause about 50,000 cases annually, 10% of which involve Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome. The picture is similar in other surrounding countries in the Americas, with recent outbreaks of severe disease, mostly associated with DENV serotype 3, strains of the Indian genotype, introduced into the Americas in 1994. RESULTS: The analysis of the 3'end (224 bp) of the envelope gene from 32 DENV-3 strains recently recovered in Colombia confirms the circulation of the Indian genotype, and surprisingly the co-circulation of an Asian-Pacific genotype only recently described in the Americas. CONCLUSION: These results have important implications for epidemiology and surveillance of DENV infection in Central and South America. Molecular surveillance of the DENV genotypes infecting humans could be a very valuable tool for controlling/mitigating the impact of the DENV infection.

29813062,2018 May,Development and validation of four one-step real-time RT-LAMP assays for specific detection of each dengue virus serotype.,"BACKGROUND: 4 one-step, real-time, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were developed for the detection of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes by considering 2,056 full genome DENV sequences. DENV1 and DENV2 RT-LAMP assays were validated with 31 blood and 11 serum samples from Tanzania, Senegal, Sudan and Mauritania. DENV3 and DENV4 RT-LAMP assays were validated with 25 serum samples from Cambodia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 4 final reaction primer mixes were obtained by using a combination of Principal Component Analysis of the full DENV genome sequences, and LAMP primer design based on sequence alignments using the LAVA software. These mixes contained 14 (DENV1), 12 (DENV2), 8 (DENV3) and 3 (DENV4) LAMP primer sets. The assays were evaluated with an External Quality Assessment panel from Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics. The assays were serotype-specific and did not cross-detect with other flaviviruses. The limits of detection, with 95% probability, were 22 (DENV1), 542 (DENV2), 197 (DENV3) and 641 (DENV4) RNA molecules, and 100% reproducibility in the assays was obtained with up to 102 (DENV1) and 103 RNA molecules (DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4). Validation of the DENV2 assay with blood samples from Tanzania resulted in 23 samples detected by RT-LAMP, demonstrating that the assay is 100% specific and 95.8% sensitive (positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 85.7%). All serum samples from Senegal, Sudan and Mauritania were detected and 3 untyped as DENV1. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP for DENV4 samples from Cambodia did not quite match qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown a novel approach to design LAMP primers that makes use of fast growing sequence databases. The DENV1 and DENV2 assays were validated with viral RNA extracted clinical samples, showing very good performance parameters. Kingdom. Kingdom. Genetics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. France.

Using standardized techniques, we analyzed isolation rates of 1,544 randomly selected polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive samples, representing all four dengue serotypes, from patients with serologically confirmed dengue infections and evaluated whether clinical and laboratory results could be predictive of isolation using standard and mosquito isolation techniques. Viruses were isolated from 62.5% of the samples by direct application to C6/36 cells and increased to 79.4% when amplifying C6/36 negative samples by intrathorasic inoculation in Toxyrhynchites splendens mosquitoes. High viremia, measured by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, was a strong predictor for viral isolation by either method. Isolation was most successful in samples collected early in the disease, had low antibody levels, temperatures greater than 38°C, and had a final clinical diagnosis of dengue fever.

9143280,1997 Apr 14,Origins of dengue type 2 viruses associated with increased pathogenicity in the Americas.,"The recent emergence and spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Americas have been a major source of concern. Efforts to control this disease are dependent on understanding the pathogenicity of dengue viruses and their transmission dynamics. Pathogenicity studies have been hampered by the lack of in vitro or in vivo models of severe dengue disease. Alternatively, molecular epidemiologic studies which associate certain dengue virus genetic types with severe dengue outbreaks may point to strains with increased pathogenicity. The comparison of nucleotide sequences (240 bp) from the E/NS1 gene region of the dengue virus genome has been shown to reflect evolutionary relationships and geographic origins of dengue virus strains. This approach was used to demonstrate an association between the introduction of two distinct genotypes of dengue type 2 virus and the appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Americas. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that these genotypes originated in Southeast Asia and that they displaced the native, American genotype in at least four countries. Vaccination and other control efforts should therefore be directed at decreasing the transmission of these ""virulent"" genotypes.

15613313,2005 Jan,Selection for virulent dengue viruses occurs in humans and mosquitoes.,"Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. The spread of both mosquito vectors and viruses has led to the resurgence of epidemic dengue fever (a self-limited flu-like syndrome) and the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (severe dengue with bleeding abnormalities) in urban centers of the tropics. There are no animal or laboratory models of dengue disease; indirect evidence suggests that dengue viruses differ in virulence, including their pathogenicities for humans and epidemic potential. We developed two assay systems (using human dendritic cells and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) for measuring differences in virus replication that correlate with the potential to cause hemorrhagic dengue and increased virus transmission. Infection and growth experiments showed that dengue serotype 2 viruses causing dengue hemorrhagic fever epidemics (Southeast Asian genotype) can outcompete viruses that cause dengue fever only (American genotype). This fact implies that Southeast Asian genotype viruses will continue to displace other viruses, causing more hemorrhagic dengue epidemics.

10933688,2000 Sep,Infection of human cells by dengue virus is modulated by different cell types and viral strains.,"Although prior studies have investigated cellular infection by dengue virus (DV), many have used highly passaged strains. We have reassessed cellular infection by DV type 2 (DV2) using prototype and low-passage isolates representing genotypes from different geographic areas. We observed marked variation in the susceptibility to infection among cell types by different DV2 strains. HepG2 hepatoma cells were susceptible to infection by all DV2 strains assayed. Although the prototype strain generated higher titers of secreted virus than the low-passage isolates, this difference did not correspond to positive- or negative-strand viral RNA levels and thus may reflect variation in efficiency among DV2 isolates to translate viral proteins or package and/or secrete virus. In contrast, human foreskin fibroblasts were susceptible to the prototype and low-passage Thai isolates but not to five Nicaraguan strains tested, as reflected by the absence of accumulation of negative-strand viral RNA, viral antigen, and infectious virus. A similar pattern was observed with the antibody-dependent pathway of infection. U937 and THP-1 myeloid cells and peripheral blood monocytes were infected in the presence of enhancing antibodies by the prototype strain but not by low-passage Nicaraguan isolates. Again, the barrier appeared to be prior to negative-strand accumulation. Thus, depending on the cell type and viral isolate, blocks that limit the production of infectious virus in vitro may occur at distinct steps in the pathway of cellular infection.

10970375,2000 Sep,Quantitative competitive reverse transcription-PCR for quantification of dengue virus RNA.,"A quantitative competitive reverse transcription-PCR assay was developed to quantify dengue virus RNA in this study. The main features include a primer pair targeting a highly conserved region in the capsid and the addition of competing RNA that contains an internal deletion to provide a stringent internal control for quantification. It can be utilized to quantify RNA isolated from the four dengue virus serotypes but not RNA isolated from other flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis C virus, both prevalent in Asia.

24189670,2013 Sep,Identification of potential hit compounds for Dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors by combining virtual screening and binding free energy calculations.,"Dengue virus (DV) infections are a serious public health problem and there is currently no vaccine or drug treatment. NS2B/NS3 protease, an essential enzyme for viral replication, is one of the promising targets in the search for drugs against DV. In this research work, virtual screening (VS) was carried out on four multi-conformational databases using several criteria. Firstly, molecular dynamics simulations of the NS2B/NS3 protease and four known inhibitors, which reveal an importance of both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions in stabilizing the ligand-enzyme interaction, were used to generate three different pharmacophore models (a structure-based, a static and a dynamic). Subsequently, these three models were employed for pharmacophore search in the VS. Secondly, compounds passing the first criterion were further reduced using the Lipinski's rule of five to keep only compounds with drug-like properties. Thirdly, molecular docking calculations were performed to remove compounds with unsuitable ligand-enzyme interactions. Finally, binding free energy of each compound was calculated. Compounds having better energy than the known inhibitors were selected and thus 20 potential hits were obtained. 10330, Thailand.","['Dengue Virus/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protease Inhibitors/*isolation & purification', 'Protein Binding', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']","['Dengue virus (DV) infections are a serious public health problem and there is currently no vaccine or drug treatment.', 'NS2B/NS3 protease, an essential enzyme for viral replication, is one of the promising targets in the search for drugs against DV.', 'In this research work, virtual screening (VS) was carried out on four multi-conformational databases using several criteria.', 'Firstly, molecular dynamics simulations of the NS2B/NS3 protease and four known inhibitors, which reveal an importance of both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions in stabilizing the ligand-enzyme interaction, were used to generate three different pharmacophore models (a structure-based, a static and a dynamic).', 'Subsequently, these three models were employed for pharmacophore search in the VS.', ""Secondly, compounds passing the first criterion were further reduced using the Lipinski's rule of five to keep only compounds with drug-like properties."", 'Thirdly, molecular docking calculations were performed to remove compounds with unsuitable ligand-enzyme interactions.', 'Finally, binding free energy of each compound was calculated.', 'Compounds having better energy than the known inhibitors were selected and thus 20 potential hits were obtained.', '10330, Thailand.']"
22647702,2012 Aug,Genome-wide patterns of intrahuman dengue virus diversity reveal associations with viral phylogenetic clade and interhost diversity.,"Analogous to observations in RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, genetic variation associated with intrahost dengue virus (DENV) populations has been postulated to influence viral fitness and disease pathogenesis. Previous attempts to investigate intrahost genetic variation in DENV characterized only a few viral genes or a limited number of full-length genomes. We developed a whole-genome amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to capture intrahost diversity across the entire coding region of DENV-2. Using this approach, we sequenced DENV-2 genomes from the serum of 22 Nicaraguan individuals with secondary DENV infection and captured ∼75% of the DENV genome in each sample (range, 40 to 98%). We identified and quantified variants using a highly sensitive and specific method and determined that the extent of diversity was considerably lower than previous estimates. Significant differences in intrahost diversity were detected between genes and also between antigenically distinct domains of the Envelope gene. Interestingly, a strong association was discerned between the extent of intrahost diversity in a few genes and viral clade identity. Additionally, the abundance of viral variants within a host, as well as the impact of viral mutations on amino acid encoding and predicted protein function, determined whether intrahost variants were observed at the interhost level in circulating Nicaraguan DENV-2 populations, strongly suggestive of purifying selection across transmission events.

15564480,2004 Dec,Identification of residues in the dengue virus type 2 NS2B cofactor that are critical for NS3 protease activation.,"Proteolytic processing of the dengue virus polyprotein is mediated by host cell proteases and the virus-encoded NS2B-NS3 two-component protease. The NS3 protease represents an attractive target for the development of antiviral inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of the NS3 protease domain has been determined, but the structural determinants necessary for activation of the enzyme by the NS2B cofactor have been characterized only to a limited extent. To test a possible functional role of the recently proposed Phix(3)Phi motif in NS3 protease activation, we targeted six residues within the NS2B cofactor by site-specific mutagenesis. Residues Trp62, Ser71, Leu75, Ile77, Thr78, and Ile79 in NS2B were replaced with alanine, and in addition, an L75A/I79A double mutant was generated. The effects of these mutations on the activity of the NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease were analyzed in vitro by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of autoproteolytic cleavage at the NS2B/NS3 site and by assay of the enzyme with the fluorogenic peptide substrate GRR-AMC. Compared to the wild type, the L75A, I77A, and I79A mutants demonstrated inefficient autoproteolysis, whereas in the W62A and the L75A/I79A mutants self-cleavage appeared to be almost completely abolished.

Properties analyzed include area per lipid values (for a spherical virion with a mixed lipid composition), bilayer thickness, and lipid diffusion coefficients. Despite the absence of cholesterol from the lipid bilayer, the virion exhibits biophysical robustness (slow lipid diffusion alongside stable bilayer thickness, virion diameter, and shape) that matches the cholesterol-rich membrane of influenza A, with similarly anomalous diffusion of lipids.

22137186,2012 Jan 20,Composition of the sequence downstream of the dengue virus 5' cyclization sequence (dCS) affects viral RNA replication.,"RNA replication of dengue virus (DENV) requires an RNA-RNA mediated circularization of the viral genome, which includes at least three sets of complementary RNA sequences on both ends of the genome. The 5' and the 3' untranslated regions form several additional RNA elements that are involved in regulation of translation and required for RNA replication. Communication between the genomic termini results in a structural reorganization of the RNA elements, forming a functional RNA panhandle structure. Here we report that the sequence composition downstream of the 5' CS element in the capsid gene, designated as downstream CS (dCS) sequence - but not the capsid protein - also influences the ability of the viral genome to circularize and hence replicate by modulating the topology of the 5' end.

32807496,2020 Oct 22,NMR structure of Dengue West Nile viruses stem-loop B: A key cis-acting element for flavivirus replication.,"Flaviviruses are major emerging human pathogenic viruses that pose a persistent and growing menace to global health. They are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses with positive polarity transmitted by arthropod vectors like mosquitoes or ticks, responsible for a significant and growing number of human deaths and illnesses. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) are highly structured and contain conserved cis-acting RNA elements that participate in viral translation, replication and host adaptation. Despite their role in fiaviviruses replication, few high-resolution structural studies have investigated the RNA elements required for viral replication. Here we report the NMR structures of stem-loop B from WNV and DENV4 viruses. Because this element is required for cyclization of the genome and the activity of the replicative viral enzymes, viral replication rates are sensitive to even small changes in these RNAs.

Therefore, we undertook a large-scale molecular epidemiological analysis of all DENV strains isolated in Thailand. In this study, we demonstrated that DENV strains of four serotypes post-1990 grouped into distinct clades, and that specific mutations in the envelope protein were first confirmed in these clades. Compared to the DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3 clades, the DENV4 clade evolved markedly more slowly (6·4 × 10-5 substitutions/site per year). Our results also showed that the genetic diversity of the predominant genotype of each serotype tended to slightly increase over time with fluctuating changes, followed by a stationary phase after 2000.

27732593,2016 Oct,Validation and Application of a Commercial Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Assay in Investigation of a Large Dengue Virus Outbreak in Southern Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate, rapid, and early diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infections is essential for optimal clinical care. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-LightMix dengue virus EC kit for DENV detection using samples from a dengue outbreak in Taiwan in 2015. METHODS: Sera from patients with suspected DENV infection were analyzed and compared using the LightMix kit, a Dengue NS1 Ag + Ab Combo kit for detection of NS1 antigen and DENV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, and an ""in-house"" qualitative DENV-specific RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: A total of 8,989, 8,954, and 1581 samples were subjected to NS1 antigen detection, IgM and IgG detection, and LightMix assays, respectively. The LightMix assay yielded a linear curve for viral loads (VL) between 102 and 106 copies/reaction, and the minimum detection limits for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1) and DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 were 1, 10, and 100 focus forming units (FFU)/mL, respectively. There was 88.9% concordance between the results obtained using the NS1 antigen combo kit and by LightMix analysis, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the two methods were 89.4 and 100%, and 84.7 and 100%, respectively. Notably, fatal cases were attributed to DENV2 infection, and 79.5% (27/34) of these cases occurred in patients ≥ 71 years of age. Among these older patients, 82.3% (14/17) were NS1/IgM/IgG (+/-/-), exhibiting VLs between 106-109 copies/mL, which was markedly higher than the rate observed in the other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The LightMix assay was effective for early diagnosis of DENV infection.

In this study, the clinical picture of dengue fever due to dengue virus (DENV) type 1 in Guangzhou was described. Clinical and laboratory data collected by studying 726 sera of suspected clinical cases from hospitals and 328 sera of healthy persons from two residence communities were analyzed during the outbreak, and 484 patients were diagnosed with an acute dengue infection. Fever, headache, congestion of the throat, and myalgia were the most typical symptoms in DENV-infected patients. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and an increase in liver enzymes were significantly more common in the infected patients than in the healthy controls. Fourteen cases of silent infection were discovered among the 328 healthy persons, suggesting a DENV inapparent infection rate of 4.27% among healthy individuals. The data obtained by analyzing 212 positive sera with three methods indicated different results with different detection methods. DENV RNA should be used for early diagnoses during days 1-6 after symptom onset, immunoglobulin M (IgM) can be easily recognized after four days have passed since symptom onset and DENV isolation has a peak positive rate during days 1-3 after the onset of symptoms. A phylogenetic analysis of viral NS1 gene sequences from this outbreak indicated that the predominant isolates could be categorized as DENV-1 genotype III and had the highest homology with the India genotypes from 2009 to 2011. However, this analysis also revealed a co-epidemic of the 2013 Zhongshan and 2003 Singapore genotypes, both belonging to DENV-1 genotype I, which suggested multiple geographic origins for the 2014 epidemic of dengue 1 strains in Guangzhou.

We previously showed that E gene sequences are identical in 11 of the 12 DENV-1 strains autochthonous to Japan. However, the E sequence represents only 14% of the DENV-1 genome. In the present study, we have sequenced the entire genome of 6 autochthonous DENV-1 strains that were isolated from patients during the 2014 outbreak. Sequencing of 5 Yoyogi group strains with identical E sequences and 1 Shizuoka strain with a different E sequence revealed that the first Yoyogi group strain differed from the Shizuoka strain by 18 amino acid residues. Furthermore, 2 Yoyogi group strains had different genomic sequences while the other 3 had identical genomes. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the Hyogo strain, a Yoyogi group strain, was the first to diverge from the other 4 Yoyogi group strains. The E gene sequence of the Yoyogi group strains exhibits the highest homology to those of the strains isolated in Malaysia and Singapore between 2013 and 2014.

18269771,2008 Feb 13,Superior infectivity for mosquito vectors contributes to competitive displacement among strains of dengue virus.,"BACKGROUND: Competitive displacement of a weakly virulent pathogen strain by a more virulent strain is one route to disease emergence. However the mechanisms by which pathogens compete for access to hosts are poorly understood. Among vector-borne pathogens, variation in the ability to infect vectors may effect displacement. The current study focused on competitive displacement in dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3), a mosquito-borne pathogen of humans. In Sri Lanka in the 1980's, a native DENV3 strain associated with relatively mild dengue disease was displaced by an invasive DENV3 strain associated with the most severe disease manifestations, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), resulting in an outbreak of DHF/DSS. Here we tested the hypothesis that differences between the invasive and native strain in their infectivity for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of DENV, contributed to the competitive success of the invasive strain RESULTS: To be transmitted by a mosquito, DENV must infect and replicate in the midgut, disseminate into the hemocoel, infect the salivary glands, and be released into the saliva. The ability of the native and invasive DENV3 strains to complete the first three steps of this process in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was measured in vivo. The invasive strain infected a similar proportion of mosquitoes as the native strain but replicated to significantly higher titers in the midgut and disseminated with significantly greater efficiency than the native strain. In contrast, the native and invasive strain showed no significant difference in replication in cultured mosquito, monkey or human cells. CONCLUSION: The invasive DENV3 strain infects and disseminates in Ae. aegypti more efficiently than the displaced native DENV3 strain, suggesting that the invasive strain is transmitted more efficiently. Replication in cultured cells did not adequately characterize the known phenotypic differences between native and invasive DENV3 strains. Infection dynamics within the vector may have a significant impact on the spread and replacement of dengue virus lineages. khanley@nmsu.edu","['Aedes/*virology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*pathogenicity/physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Insect Vectors/*virology', 'Serotyping', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virulence', '*Virus Replication']","['BACKGROUND: Competitive displacement of a weakly virulent pathogen strain by a more virulent strain is one route to disease emergence.', 'However the mechanisms by which pathogens compete for access to hosts are poorly understood.', 'Among vector-borne pathogens, variation in the ability to infect vectors may effect displacement.', 'The current study focused on competitive displacement in dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3), a mosquito-borne pathogen of humans.', ""In Sri Lanka in the 1980's, a native DENV3 strain associated with relatively mild dengue disease was displaced by an invasive DENV3 strain associated with the most severe disease manifestations, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), resulting in an outbreak of DHF/DSS."", 'Here we tested the hypothesis that differences between the invasive and native strain in their infectivity for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of DENV, contributed to the competitive success of the invasive strain RESULTS: To be transmitted by a mosquito, DENV must infect and replicate in the midgut, disseminate into the hemocoel, infect the salivary glands, and be released into the saliva.', 'The ability of the native and invasive DENV3 strains to complete the first three steps of this process in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was measured in vivo.', 'The invasive strain infected a similar proportion of mosquitoes as the native strain but replicated to significantly higher titers in the midgut and disseminated with significantly greater efficiency than the native strain.', 'In contrast, the native and invasive strain showed no significant difference in replication in cultured mosquito, monkey or human cells.', 'CONCLUSION: The invasive DENV3 strain infects and disseminates in Ae. aegypti more efficiently than the displaced native DENV3 strain, suggesting that the invasive strain is transmitted more efficiently.', 'Replication in cultured cells did not adequately characterize the known phenotypic differences between native and invasive DENV3 strains.', 'Infection dynamics within the vector may have a significant impact on the spread and replacement of dengue virus lineages.', 'khanley@nmsu.edu']"

To determine the contribution of the FG loop to virus infectivity, an infectious cDNA clone of DENV2 was manipulated by deleting amino acids in the loop (VEPGΔ) to mimic tick-borne flaviviruses or by substituting these AAs with RGD or RGDK/S to mimic motifs present in other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. We found the FG loop to be dispensable for infection of C6/36 cells but critical for infection of Aedes aegypti mosquito midguts and mammalian cells. All the FG loop mutants were able to bind to and enter mammalian cells but replication of VEPGΔ in Vero cells at 37 °C was delayed until acquisition of secondary mutations.

25392211,2015 Jan 15,Two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for dengue virus RNA synthesis and virion assembly.,"Flavivirus nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) plays important roles in both viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly. The molecular details of how the NS2A protein modulates the two distinct events have not been defined. To address this question, we have performed a systematic mutagenesis of NS2A using dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model. We identified two sets of NS2A mutations with distinct defects during a viral infection cycle. One set of NS2A mutations (D125A and G200A) selectively abolished viral RNA synthesis. Mechanistically, the D125A mutation abolished viral RNA synthesis through blocking the N-terminal cleavage of the NS2A protein, leading to an unprocessed NS1-NS2A protein; this result suggests that amino acid D125 (far downstream of the N terminus of NS2A) may contribute to the recognition of host protease at the NS1-NS2A junction. The other set of NS2A mutations (G11A, E20A, E100A, Q187A, and K188A) specifically impaired virion assembly without significantly affecting viral RNA synthesis. Remarkably, mutants defective in virion assembly could be rescued by supplying in trans wild-type NS2A molecules expressed from a replicative replicon, by wild-type NS2A protein expressed alone, by a mutant NS2A (G200A) that is lethal for viral RNA synthesis, or by a different mutant NS2A that is defective in virion assembly. In contrast, none of the mutants defective in viral RNA synthesis could be rescued by trans-complementation. Collectively, the results indicate that two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for DENV RNA synthesis and virion assembly. IMPORTANCE: Dengue virus (DENV) represents the most prevalent mosquito-borne human pathogen. Understanding the replication of DENV is essential for development of vaccines and therapeutics. Here we characterized the function of DENV-2 NS2A using a systematic mutagenesis approach. The mutagenesis results revealed two distinct sets of NS2A mutations: one set of mutations that result in defects in viral RNA synthesis and another set of mutations that result in defects in virion assembly. trans-Complementation analysis showed that mutants defective in viral RNA synthesis could not be rescued by wild-type NS2A; in contrast, mutants defective in virion assembly could be successfully rescued by wild-type NS2A or even by a mutant NS2A that is incompetent to support viral RNA synthesis. These results support a model in which two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for DENV RNA synthesis (located in the viral replication complex) and virion assembly (located in the virion assembly/budding site). The study confirms and extends our understanding of the two critical roles of flavivirus NS2A in viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly.

20357095,2010 Jun,Interplay of RNA elements in the dengue virus 5' and 3' ends required for viral RNA replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus of positive-sense RNA viruses. DENV RNA replication requires cyclization of the viral genome mediated by two pairs of complementary sequences in the 5' and 3' ends, designated 5' and 3' cyclization sequences (5'-3' CS) and the 5' and 3' upstream of AUG region (5'-3' UAR). Here, we demonstrate that another stretch of six nucleotides in the 5' end is involved in DENV replication and possibly genome cyclization. This new sequence is located downstream of the AUG, designated the 5' downstream AUG region (5' DAR); the motif predicted to be complementary in the 3' end is termed the 3' DAR. In addition to the UAR, CS and DAR motifs, two other RNA elements are located at the 5' end of the viral RNA: the 5' stem-loop A (5' SLA) interacts with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotes RNA synthesis, and a stem-loop in the coding region named cHP is involved in translation start site selection as well as RNA replication. We analyzed the interplay of these 5' RNA elements in relation to RNA replication, and our data indicate that two separate functional units are formed; one consists of the SLA, and the other includes the UAR, DAR, cHP, and CS elements. The SLA must be located at the 5' end of the genome, whereas the position of the second unit is more flexible.

28599640,2017 Jun 9,"Dengue type 4 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: case characterization following its introduction in an endemic region.","BACKGROUND: Due to the populations' susceptibility, DENV-4 introduction in 2010 led to the occurrence of explosive epidemics in the following years in Brazil. In 2011, DENV-4 was identified in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and it was prevalent in 2012 and 2013. Here, we aimed to characterize clinical, epidemiological and laboratorial aspects of DENV-4 cases after this serotype introduction in an endemic scenario. METHODS: Dengue suspected cases (n = 3727) were received and analyzed from January 2011 to December 2013, during outbreaks occurred in RJ, Brazil. Samples were submitted to virological, serological and molecular methods for case confirmation. DENV-4 cases (n = 705) were characterized according to the type of infection, disease severity and, viremia levels and NS1 antigenemia were accessed. Representative strains were partial sequenced for genotyping. RESULTS: DENV-4 was identified in 44.2% (705/1593) of dengue positive cases, virus isolated in 48.7% of the cases. Anti-DENV IgM was detected in 39.4% of the cases, however an increased detection was observed in cases with ≥4 days of symptoms (57.0%). NS1 antigen was identified in 41.5% of DENV-4 cases however, after immune complexes dissociation, the detection significantly increased (87.6%). Females were more affected than males, so did children aged 11-15 years old. Primary cases were more frequently observed than secondary ones and most of them were classified as dengue. No differences on NS1 antigenemia and viraemia within the groups were observed. Despite the higher frequency of severe disease on individuals >65 years old, no differences were observed among the groups and type of infection. However, DENV-4 fatal cases were more frequent on secondary infections (57.1%). DENV-4 Genotype II was identified with a probable origin from Venezuela and Colombia. CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that laboratorial diagnosis is still a reliable tool for the disease surveillance, detecting and confirming emerging epidemics. Despite the occurrence of secondary infections, most DENV-4 cases presented a mild disease. As RJ is endemic for dengue, high rates of secondary infections would be expected. Despite the existence of two genotypes, only Genotype II was identified in our study. Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21045-360, Brazil. Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21045-360, Brazil.

12680353,2001 Summer,Differential susceptibility of Aedes aegypti to infection by the American and Southeast Asian genotypes of dengue type 2 virus.,"Outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever have coincided with the introduction of the Southeast (SE) Asian genotype of dengue type 2 virus in the Western Hemisphere. This introduced genotype appears to be rapidly displacing the indigenous, American genotype of dengue 2 virus throughout the region. These field observations raise the possibility that the SE Asian genotype of dengue 2 is better adapted for vector transmission than its American counterpart. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the ability of viral strains of the SE Asian and American genotypes to infect, replicate, and disseminate within vector mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti). Viral strains of the SE Asian genotype tended to infect and disseminate more efficiently in mosquitoes than did variants of the American genotype. These differences, however, were observed solely in field-derived mosquitoes, whereas viral infection rates were virtually identical in the laboratory-adapted Rockefeller colony of Ae. aegypti. Our findings could provide a physiological basis for the contrasting patterns of dengue virus genotype transmission and spread. Such an understanding of functional differences between viral strains and genotypes may ultimately improve surveillance and intervention strategies.

30165044,2018 Jul-Aug,"Differences in the replicative capacities of clinical isolates of dengue virus in C6/36 cells and in urban populations of Aedes aegypti from Colombia, South America.","Dengue, the most prevalent arboviral disease worldwide, is caused by any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes that co-circulate constantly in hyperendemic areas such as Medellin (Colombia), and these serotypes are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. In this study, we evaluated the replicative capacity of strains isolated in Medellin between 2003 and 2007 in C6/36 cells and in colonies of Aedes aegypti collected during 2010-2011 from high or low-incidence areas within the same city. The phylogenetic analysis grouped isolates according to the predominant genotypes found in the Americas, and the in vitro characterization showed differences in the morphological changes induced by the isolates of each of the isolated serotypes compared to the reference serotypes. In vitro replicative capacity studies demonstrated that genomic copy number increased at four days post-infection and that cell viability decreased significantly compared to the control for all serotypes. The largest number of genomic copies in C6/36 was produced by DENV-2, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-4; DENV-3 produced the smallest number of genomic copies and had the smallest negative effect on cell viability. Finally, differences in the in vivo replication of intercolonial serotypes between the Rockefeller colony and the field colonies and among the intracolonial serotypes were found. The replication of DENV-2 at 7 and 14 days in both high- and low-incidence colonies was higher than that of the other serotypes, and replication of DENV-3 in the mosquito colonies was the most stable on the days evaluated. Our results support the notion that replication and, possibly, DENV transmission and severity depend on many factors, including serotype and vector characteristics. Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

21539658,2011 May-Jun,Molecular surveillance of circulating dengue genotypes through European travelers.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most widespread arthropod-borne viruses, which have shown an unexpected geographic expansion, as well as an increase in number and severity of outbreaks in the last decades. Although the emergence of dengue is considered to be due to a number of complex factors, epidemiological studies have shown that some strains of dengue might be associated with increased severity and higher transmission rates than others. In this context, surveillance and identification of the appearance or introduction of more virulent strains, along with fluctuation of DENV among endemic areas are now considered essential public health activities. METHODS: Samples from travelers returning from the tropics with acute dengue infections were analyzed to obtain up-dated information on circulating dengue strains. A short nucleotide fragment located in the carboxyl terminus of the dengue E gene was used for the characterization of DENV strains and the identification of their sero- and genotype. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six new dengue strains have been classified into 12 distinct genotype groups within the four dengue serotypes. The identification of the emergence of different sero- and genotypes, the appearance of new clades correlating with outbreaks, and the identification of a dengue-4 genotype not previously reported have been achieved. Interestingly, African strains characterized in this study have provided valuable data on dengue circulation on the continent. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the convenience of routine application of molecular epidemiology analyses in dengue diagnosis laboratories. The use of molecular epidemiology tools on the analysis of imported dengue infections strengthens data acquisition on dengue strain movements correlating with epidemiological changes. The importance of surveillance of imported diseases contributing data for the epidemiological knowledge of infectious diseases in endemic areas has been once more demonstrated.

Its evolving phylogeny over the past decade has not been studied in detail as yet. METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of the CprM gene junction of DENV-3 from different outbreaks since 2003 was carried out. Thirty CprM DENV-3 sequences from this study were compared with 46 other previously reported CprM DENV-3 sequences from India and other countries. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine the extent of genetic heterogeneity and trace the phylogeny of DENV-3.

The information about DENV circulation in mosquitoes in Colombian rural areas is limited, so we aimed to evaluate the presence of DENV in Ae. aegypti females caught in rural locations of two Colombian municipalities, Anapoima and La Mesa. Mosquitoes from 497 rural households in 44 different rural settlements were collected. Pools of about 20 Ae. aegypti females were processed for DENV serotype detection. DENV in mosquitoes was detected in 74% of the analysed settlements with a pool positivity rate of 62%. The estimated individual mosquito infection rate was 4.12% and the minimum infection rate was 33.3/1,000 mosquitoes. All four serotypes were detected; the most frequent being DENV-2 (50%) and DENV-1 (35%). Two-three serotypes were detected simultaneously in separate pools. This is the first report on the co-occurrence of natural DENV infection of mosquitoes in Colombian rural areas. The findings are important for understanding dengue transmission and planning control strategies.

22090119,2012 Jan,High-resolution analysis of intrahost genetic diversity in dengue virus serotype 1 infection identifies mixed infections.,"Little is known about the rate at which genetic variation is generated within intrahost populations of dengue virus (DENV) and what implications this diversity has for dengue pathogenesis, disease severity, and host immunity. Previous studies of intrahost DENV variation have used a low frequency of sampling and/or experimental methods that do not fully account for errors generated through amplification and sequencing of viral RNAs. We investigated the extent and pattern of genetic diversity in sequence data in domain III (DIII) of the envelope (E) gene in serial plasma samples (n = 49) taken from 17 patients infected with DENV type 1 (DENV-1), totaling some 8,458 clones. Statistically rigorous approaches were employed to account for artifactual variants resulting from amplification and sequencing, which we suggest have played a major role in previous studies of intrahost genetic variation. Accordingly, nucleotide sequence diversities of viral populations were very low, with conservative estimates of the average levels of genetic diversity ranging from 0 to 0.0013. Despite such sequence conservation, we observed clear evidence for mixed infection, with the presence of multiple phylogenetically distinct lineages present within the same host, while the presence of stop codon mutations in some samples suggests the action of complementation. In contrast to some previous studies we observed no relationship between the extent and pattern of DENV-1 genetic diversity and disease severity, immune status, or level of viremia.

Here, we evaluated the potential for DENV-1 to escape neutralization by DENV1-E106. A single mutation in domain III of the envelope protein (T329A) emerged, which conferred resistance to DENV1-E106. However, the T329A variant virus had differing phenotypes in vitro and in vivo with attenuation in cell culture yet increased infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Mice infected with this T329A variant still were protected against lethal infection by DENV1-E106 even though much of the neutralizing activity was lost.

27716465,2016 Dec,Evasion of early innate immune response by 2'-O-methylation of dengue genomic RNA.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus pathogen in humans. There is currently no antiviral therapeutic or widely available vaccine against dengue infection. The DENV RNA genome is methylated on its 5' cap by its NS5 protein. DENV bearing a single E216A point mutation in NS5 loses 2'-O-methylation of its genome. While this mutant DENV is highly attenuated and immunogenic, the mechanism of this attenuation has not been elucidated.

This early attenuation is not dependent on a functional type I interferon response and coincides with early activation of the innate immune response.

16966609,2006 Sep 19,Cross-protective immunity can account for the alternating epidemic pattern of dengue virus serotypes circulating in Bangkok.,"Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever and its more serious manifestation dengue hemorrhagic fever, is widespread throughout tropical and subtropical regions. The virus exists as four distinct serotypes, all of which have cocirculated in Bangkok for several decades with epidemic outbreaks occurring every 8-10 years. We analyze time-series data of monthly infection incidence, revealing a distinctive pattern with epidemics of serotypes 1, 2, and 3 occurring at approximately the same time and an isolated epidemic of serotype 4 occurring in the intervening years. Phylogenetic analysis of virus samples collected over the same period shows that clade replacement events are linked to the epidemic cycle and indicates that there is an interserotypic immune reaction. Using an epidemic model with stochastic seasonal forcing showing 8- to 10-year epidemic oscillations, we demonstrate that moderate cross-protective immunity gives rise to persistent out-of-phase oscillations similar to those observed in the data, but that strong or weak cross-protection or cross-enhancement only produces in-phase patterns. This behavior suggests that the epidemic pattern observed in Bangkok is the result of cross-protective immunity and may be significantly altered by changes in the interserotypic immune reaction. 2TN, United Kingdom. ben@bio-math10.biology","['Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/genetics/*immunology', '*Endemic Diseases', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Immunity/*physiology', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Periodicity', 'Phylogeny', '*Serotyping', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']","['Dengue virus, the causative agent of dengue fever and its more serious manifestation dengue hemorrhagic fever, is widespread throughout tropical and subtropical regions.', 'The virus exists as four distinct serotypes, all of which have cocirculated in Bangkok for several decades with epidemic outbreaks occurring every 8-10 years.', 'We analyze time-series data of monthly infection incidence, revealing a distinctive pattern with epidemics of serotypes 1, 2, and 3 occurring at approximately the same time and an isolated epidemic of serotype 4 occurring in the intervening years.', 'Phylogenetic analysis of virus samples collected over the same period shows that clade replacement events are linked to the epidemic cycle and indicates that there is an interserotypic immune reaction.', 'Using an epidemic model with stochastic seasonal forcing showing 8- to 10-year epidemic oscillations, we demonstrate that moderate cross-protective immunity gives rise to persistent out-of-phase oscillations similar to those observed in the data, but that strong or weak cross-protection or cross-enhancement only produces in-phase patterns.', 'This behavior suggests that the epidemic pattern observed in Bangkok is the result of cross-protective immunity and may be significantly altered by changes in the interserotypic immune reaction.', '2TN, United Kingdom.', 'ben@bio-math10.biology']"

The rates of virus binding, virus entry, input strand translation, and RNA stability of low-passage Thai and Nicaraguan and prototype DEN2 strains were compared. All strains exhibited equivalent binding, entry, and uncoating, and displayed comparable stability of positive strand viral RNA over time in primary cells. However, the low-passage Nicaraguan isolates were much less efficient in their ability to translate viral proteins. Sequence analysis of the full-length low-passage Nicaraguan and Thai viral genomes identified specific differences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Substitution of the different sequences into chimeric RNA reporter constructs demonstrated that the changes in the 3'UTR directly affected the efficiency of viral translation.

9332607,1997 May-Jun,A simple reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for dengue type 2 virus identification.,"We show here a simplified reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for identification of dengue type 2 virus. Three dengue type 2 virus strains, isolated from Brazilian patients, and yellow fever vaccine 17DD, as a negative control, were used in this study. C6/36 cells were infected with the virus, and tissue culture fluids were collected after 7 days of infection period. The RT-PCR, a combination of RT and PCR done after a single addition of reagents in a single reaction vessel was carried out following a digestion of virus with 1% Nonidet P-40. The 50 microliters assay reaction mixture included 50 pmol of a dengue type 2 specific primer pair amplifying a 210 base pair sequence of the envelope protein gene, 0.1 mM of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 7.5 U of reverse transcriptase, and IU of thermostable Taq DNA polymerase. The reagent mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 degrees C for RT followed by a variable amount of cycles of two-step PCR amplification (92 degrees C for 60 sec, 53 degrees C for 60 sec) with slow temperature increment. The PCR products were subjected to 1.7% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with UV light after gel incubation in ethidium bromide solution.

27257804,2016,"Epidemiological and Virological Characterizations of the 2014 Dengue Outbreak in Guangzhou, China.","Dengue used to be recognized as an imported and sporadic disease in China. Since June 2014, an unexpected large dengue outbreak has attacked Guangzhou, China, resulting in more than 40,000 cases. Among the 1,942 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized dengue cases, 121 were diagnosed as severe dengue according to the 2009 WHO guideline, and 2 patients finally died. Laboratory diagnosis and virus isolation demonstrated that the majority (96%) cases were caused by dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), and the others by serotype 2 (DENV-2). 14 DENV strains were isolated from the sera of acute-phase dengue patients during this outbreak, and the complete envelope (E) gene of 12 DENV-1 strains and two DENV-2 strains were determined using RT-PCR assay. Phylogenetic analysis based on the E gene revealed the DENV-1 strains isolated during the outbreak belonged to genotype I and V, respectively. These isolates formed three clades. DENV-2 isolates were assigned to the same clade belonging to genotype cosmopolitan. These strains isolated in 2014 were closely related to the isolates obtained from the same province, Guangdong, in 2013. No amino acid mutations known to increase virulence were identified throughout the E protein of isolates in 2014. These results indicate that dengue is turning into endemic in Guangdong, China, and extensive seroepidemiological investigation and mosquito control measures are critically needed in the future.

21821995,2012,Recombination in the nonstructural gene region in type 2 dengue viruses.,"In view of the rising prevalence of dengue virus and mixing of host and vector populations, complete full-length sequence determination of dengue strains isolated from different epidemic areas is important for the study of virus evolution, pathogenicity, vaccine efficiency and diagnosis. Based on the genomic analysis of 51 complete dengue virus sequences, all of which cocirculated in Thailand between 1974 and 2001, we report here the occurrence of homologous recombination in the NS5 nonstructural gene region of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) strains. In order to analyze those 51 virus sequences at one time, we chose to use a highly sensitive recombination detection program called RDP. When RDP detects a possible recombination event, further bootscanning and phylogenetic tree analyses are applied to these candidate sequences to identify this recombination event. We found that within the DENV-2 subfamily, the strain ThNH63/93 is the evolutionary product of a recombination event between ThNH62/93 and ThD2_0284_90 strains. The strain ThNH62/93 was identified as the major parent, while the strain ThD2_0284_90 was the minor parent. The recombination site was determined to localize between positions 7967 (± 36 nt) and 8283 (± 36 nt) with a significance level of p < 0.001. Our results showed, for the first time, that an intraserotype recombination event occurred between DENV-2 strains in the nonstructural gene region; by contrast, an interserotype recombination between different serotypes of dengue strains was not identified. This study thus supports the theory that homologous recombination plays a key role in dengue virus evolution.

22190239,2011 Dec 21,Dynamics of dengue disease severity determined by the interplay between viral genetics and serotype-specific immunity.,"The rapid spread of dengue is a worldwide public health problem. In two clinical studies of dengue in Managua, Nicaragua, we observed an abrupt increase in disease severity across several epidemic seasons of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) transmission. Waning DENV-1 immunity appeared to increase the risk of severe disease in subsequent DENV-2 infections after a period of cross-protection. The increase in severity coincided with replacement of the Asian/American DENV-2 NI-1 clade with a new virus clade, NI-2B. In vitro analyses of viral isolates from the two clades and analysis of viremia in patient blood samples support the emergence of a fitter virus in later, relative to earlier, epidemic seasons. In addition, the NI-1 clade of viruses was more virulent specifically in children who were immune to DENV-1, whereas DENV-3 immunity was associated with more severe disease among NI-2B infections. Our data demonstrate that the complex interaction between viral genetics and population dynamics of serotype-specific immunity contributes to the risk of severe dengue disease. Furthermore, this work provides insights into viral evolution and the interaction between viral and immunological determinants of viral fitness and virulence.

18209927,2007 Dec,"The dynamics of dengue virus serotype 3 introduction and dispersion in the state of Bahia, Brazil.","By 2002, dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) and DENV-2 had circulated for more than a decade in Brazil. In 2002, the introduction of DENV-3 in the state of Bahia produced a massive epidemic and the first cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Based on the standardized frequency, timing and location of viral isolations by the state's Central Laboratory, DENV-3 probably entered Bahia through its capital, Salvador, and then rapidly disseminated to other cities, following the main roads. A linear regression model that included traffic flow, distance from the capital and DENV-1 circulation (r2 = 0.24, p = 0.001) supported this hypothesis. This pattern was not seen for serotypes already in circulation and was not seen for DENV-3 in the following year. Human population density was another important factor in the intensity of viral circulation. Neither DENV-1 nor DENV-2 fit this model for 2001 or 2003. Since the vector has limited flight range and vector densities fail to correlate with intensity of viral circulation, this distribution represents the movement of infected people and to some extent mosquitoes.

We studied occurrence of co-infection with dengue viruses during an outbreak in New Delhi, India in 2014. For the present study, blood samples collected from symptomatic patients were analysed by RT-PCR. Eighty percent of the samples were positive for dengue virus. The result showed that DENV-1 (77%) was the predominant serotype followed by DENV-2 (60%). Concurrent infection with more than one serotype was identified in 43% of the positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis clustered DENV-1 strains with the American African and DENV-2 strains in Cosmopolitan genotypes.

Using infectious cDNA clones, we constructed 18 recombinant 16681/PDK-53 viruses to analyze four 16681-to-PDK-53 mutations, including 5' noncoding region (5'NC)-57 C-to-T, premembrane (prM)-29 Asp-to-Val (the only mutation that occurs in the structural proteins), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-53 Gly-to-Asp, and NS3-250 Glu-to-Val. The viruses were studied for plaque size, growth rate, and temperature sensitivity in LLC-MK(2) cells, growth rate in C6/36 cells, and neurovirulence in newborn mice. All of the viruses replicated to peak titers of 10(7.3) PFU/ml or greater in LLC-MK(2) cells. The crippled replication of PDK-53 virus in C6/36 cells and its attenuation for mice were determined primarily by the 5'NC-57-T and NS1-53-Asp mutations. The temperature sensitivity of PDK-53 virus was attributed to the NS1-53-Asp and NS3-250-Val mutations. The 5'NC-57, NS1-53, and NS3-250 loci all contributed to the small-plaque phenotype of PDK-53 virus. Reversions at two or three of these loci in PDK-53 virus were required to reconstitute the phenotypic characteristics of the parental 16681 virus.

Each well was exposed to a different dilution of dengue infected culture fluid, followed by addition of first and second overlay medium. Cells were observed under an inverted microscope and plaque staining was carried out. The results showed that countable plaques were not achieved and plaques formed were restricted to the central section due to the significant partial lysis of the C6/36 cells in the plates.

24205075,2013,First evidence of simultaneous circulation of three different dengue virus serotypes in Africa.,"Gabon, in Central Africa, was affected for the first time in 2007 and then in 2010 by simultaneous outbreaks of chikungunya and Dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) viruses. Through the national surveillance of dengue-like syndromes between 2007 and 2010, we observed continuous circulation of DENV-2 in a southward movement. This rapid spread of DENV-2 was associated with the emergence of DENV-1 in 2007 and DENV-3 in 2010. Interestingly, we detected six DENV-2 infected patients with hemorrhagic signs during the second outbreak in 2010. Although these cases do not meet all standard WHO criteria for severe Dengue with hemorrhage (formerly DHF), this is the first report of several dengue fever cases associated with hemorrhagic signs during a simultaneous circulation of different DENV serotypes in Africa. Together, these findings suggest that DENV is becoming more widely established on this continent and that DHF will likely become a serious public-health problem in the near future.

14512579,2003 Oct,Patterns of intra- and interhost nonsynonymous variation reveal strong purifying selection in dengue virus.,"Considerable uncertainty surrounds the evolutionary rates of and selection pressures acting on arthropod-borne RNA viruses (arboviruses). In particular, it is unclear why arboviruses such as dengue virus show substantial genetic variation within individual humans and mosquitoes yet low long-term rates of amino acid substitution. To address this question, I compared patterns of nonsynonymous variation in populations of dengue virus sampled at different levels of evolutionary divergence. Although nonsynonymous variation was abundant in viral populations within individual humans, there was a marked reduction in the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations in interhost comparisons. Moreover, intrahost genetic variation corresponded to a random pattern of mutation, and most of the sites that exhibited nonsynonymous variation within hosts were invariant at deeper phylogenetic levels. This loss of long-term nonsynonymous variation is the signature of extensive purifying selection such that more than 90% of all nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious. Consequently, although arboviruses are able to successfully adapt to diverse cell types, they are characterized by a high rate of deleterious mutation.

31268687,2019 Jul 16,Effects of Refolding on Large-Scale RNA Structure.,"Understanding RNA-mediated functions requires a detailed characterization of the underlying RNA structure. In many cases, structure probing experiments are performed on RNA that has been ""refolded"" in some way, which may cause the conformation to differ from that of the native RNA. We used SHAPE-MaP (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension, read out by mutational profiling), to probe the structure of the Dengue virus (DENV) RNA genome after gentle extraction of the native RNA from intact virions (ex virion) and after heat denaturation and refolding. Comparison of mutiple SHAPE-informed structural features revealed that refolded RNA is more highly structured and samples fewer conformations than the ex virion RNA. Regions with similar structural features are generally those with low SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy (lowSS regions), which correspond to elements with high levels of well-determined structure. This high-structure and low-entropy analysis framework, previously shown to make possible discovery of functional RNA structures, is thus now shown to allow de novo identification of structural elements in a refolded RNA that are likely to recapitulate RNA structures in the ex virion RNA state. Regions with less well-defined structures, which occurred more frequently in the more native-like ex virion RNA and may contain RNA switches, are challenging to recapitulate using refolded RNA.

20651932,2010 Jul 20,Emergence of the Asian 1 genotype of dengue virus serotype 2 in viet nam: in vivo fitness advantage and lineage replacement in South-East Asia.,"A better description of the extent and structure of genetic diversity in dengue virus (DENV) in endemic settings is central to its eventual control. To this end we determined the complete coding region sequence of 187 DENV-2 genomes and 68 E genes from viruses sampled from Vietnamese patients between 1995 and 2009. Strikingly, an episode of genotype replacement was observed, with Asian 1 lineage viruses entirely displacing the previously dominant Asian/American lineage viruses. This genotype replacement event also seems to have occurred within DENV-2 in Thailand and Cambodia, suggestive of a major difference in viral fitness. To determine the cause of this major evolutionary event we compared both the infectivity of the Asian 1 and Asian/American genotypes in mosquitoes and their viraemia levels in humans. Although there was little difference in infectivity in mosquitoes, we observed significantly higher plasma viraemia levels in paediatric patients infected with Asian 1 lineage viruses relative to Asian/American viruses, a phenotype that is predicted to result in a higher probability of human-to-mosquito transmission. These results provide a mechanistic basis to a marked change in the genetic structure of DENV-2 and more broadly underscore that an understanding of DENV evolutionary dynamics can inform the development of vaccines and anti-viral drugs.

The larvae and mosquitoes of Stegomyia albopicta were used to identify the vertical transmission of the dengue virus in nature and to confirm the vectorial capacity concerning the Dengue virus type 2 infection. The minimum infection rate concerning S. albopicta infection with the Dengue virus was 1:36.45.

9445071,1998 Feb,Genetic determinants responsible for acquisition of dengue type 2 virus mouse neurovirulence.,"Studies conducted some 50 years ago showed that serial intracerebral passage of dengue viruses in mice selected for neurovirulent mutants that also exhibited significant attenuation for humans. We investigated the genetic basis of mouse neurovirulence of dengue virus because it might be directly or indirectly associated with attenuation for humans. Analysis of the sequence in the C-PreM-E-NS1 region of the parental dengue type 2 virus (DEN2) New Guinea C (NGC) strain and its mouse-adapted, neurovirulent mutant revealed that 10 nucleotide changes occurred during serial passage in mice. Seven of these changes resulted in amino acid substitutions, i.e., Leu55-Phe and Arg57-Lys in PreM, Glu71-Asp, Glu126-Lys, Phe402-Ile, and Thr454-Ile in E, and Arg105-Gln in NS1. The sequence of C was fully conserved between the parental and mutant DEN2. We constructed intertypic chimeric dengue viruses that contained the PreM-E genes or only the NS1 gene of neurovirulent DEN2 NGC substituting for the corresponding genes of DEN4. The DEN2 (PreM-E)/DEN4 chimera was neurovirulent for mice, whereas DEN2 (NS1)/DEN4 was not. The mutations present in the neurovirulent DEN2 PreM-E genes were then substituted singly or in combination into the sequence of the nonneurovirulent, parental DEN2. Intracerebral titration of the various mutant chimeras so produced identified two amino acid changes, namely, Glu71-Asp and Glu126-Lys, in DEN2 E as being responsible for mouse neurovirulence. The conservative amino acid change of Gu71-Asp probably had a minor effect, if any. The Glu126-Lys substitution in DEN2 E, representing a change from a negatively charged amino acid to a positively charged amino acid, most likely plays an important role in conferring mouse neurovirulence.

16597885,2006 Apr,Use of a short fragment of the C-terminal E gene for detection and characterization of two new lineages of dengue virus 1 in India.,"Here we propose the use of a 216-nucleotide fragment located in the carboxyl terminus of the E gene (E-COOH) and a pairwise-based comparison method for genotyping of dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) strains. We have applied this method to the detection and characterization of DENV-1 in serum samples from travelers returning from the tropics. The results obtained with the typing system correlate with the results obtained by comparison of the sequences of the entire E gene of the strains. The approach demonstrates utility in plotting the distribution and circulation of different genotypes of DENV-1 and also suggests the presence of two new clades of Indian strains. The integration of the method with an online database and a typing characterization tool enhances its strength. Additionally, the analysis of the complete E gene of DENV-1 strains suggested the occurrence of a nondescribed recombination event in the China GD23-95 strain. We propose the use of this methodology as a tool for real-time epidemiological surveillance of dengue virus infections and their pathogenesis.

Collection of serum from patients is time- and labor- consuming, and presents a high injury risk for infants and children. The genomic and serological diagnosis of imported dengue fever from a urine sample was used as a non-invasive diagnostic method in this study. A serum sample was collected on disease day 5, and a serum and urine sample were collected on disease day 8 and 18. The results of serological tests for DENV IgM revealed that the serum samples were positive for DENV. The results of RT-qPCR assay revealed that the serum sample collected on day 5 was DENV-positive; however, the serum sample collected on day 8 and 18 were negative for DENV. The urine sample collected on day 8 and 18 were DENV-positive. We also sequenced the complete DENV genome (10723 bp) from the urine sample (GenBank KF479233). The results of phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis indicated strong confirmation that the strain was located within the DENV-2 group with a 100% bootstrap value.

RESULTS: Using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Taiwan's indigenous DENV-3 isolated from 1994 and 1998 dengue/DHF epidemics and one 1999 sporadic case were of the three different genotypes - I, II, and III, each associated with DENV-3 circulating in Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka, respectively. Sequence diversity and selection pressure of different genomic regions among DENV-3 different genotypes was further examined to understand the global DENV-3 evolution. The highest nucleotide sequence diversity among the fully sequenced DENV-3 strains was found in the nonstructural protein 2A (mean +/- SD: 5.84 +/- 0.54) and envelope protein gene regions (mean +/- SD: 5.04 +/- 0.32). Further analysis found that positive selection pressure of DENV-3 may occur in the non-structural protein 1 gene region and the positive selection site was detected at position 178 of the NS1 gene. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that the envelope protein is under purifying selection pressure although it presented higher sequence diversity. The detection of positive selection pressure in the non-structural protein along genotype II indicated that DENV-3 originated from Southeast Asia needs to monitor the emergence of DENV strains with epidemic potential for better epidemic prevention and vaccine development.

31424004,2019 Jan-Mar,Molecular studies on dengue viruses detected in patients from Central India.,"PURPOSE: Dengue viruses (DENVs), the causative agents of dengue (DEN), are classified into four serotypes and several genotypes. Identifying circulating serotypes and genotypes has clinical and epidemiological importance; however, limited information in this regard is available from Central India. This laboratory-based study was done to fill this lacuna. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples collected in the acute phase of illness were subjected to DEN NS1 ELISA, and NS1-positive samples (n = 80) were subjected to serotyping; representative samples from each serotype were sequenced to identify genotypes. RESULTS: Seventy-one (88.75%) samples could be serotyped. All the four DENV serotypes with dominance of DENV-3 (n = 33; 47%) were detected. DENV-4 was detected after a gap of 3 years. Cases with multiple DENV serotype infection were identified. Genotyping showed that DENV-1 belonging to genotype III, DENV-2 cosmopolitan (IV), DENV-3 genotype III lineage C and DENV-4 genotype I were in circulation in the year 2016. CONCLUSION: Our study documents the molecular characteristics of DENV circulating in the area. Detection of heterologous DENV serotype with dominance of DENV-3 emphasises the need for regular molecular monitoring. Health, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India.

7609092,1995 Aug,Construction of intertypic chimeric dengue viruses exhibiting type 3 antigenicity and neurovirulence for mice.,"There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1 to -4), each of which causes major epidemics in tropical or subtropical areas. The current strategy for dengue virus immunization favors the use of a tetravalent vaccine preparation. We have previously employed full-length DEN4 cDNA to construct a viable intertypic dengue virus type 1 or type 2 chimera that contained the C-PreM-E or only the PreM-E genes of DEN1 or DEN2 substituting for the corresponding genes of DEN4. This success implied that it might be possible to create mutants of all four dengue virus serotypes for evaluation as candidate vaccines. In this study, we constructed DEN3-DEN4 chimeras that contained DEN3 C-PreM-E genes and expressed DEN3 antigenic specificity. Unlike our previous successes in cloning DEN1 or DEN2 chimeric cDNA, we were not able to clone the DEN3 C-PreM-E genes directly in the 5' intermediate vector or in the full-length chimeric DEN3-DEN4 plasmid in Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, a full-length DNA template of DEN3-DEN4 that could be used for transcription of infections RNAs was prepared by in vitro ligation. Progeny virus recovered from RNA-transfected C6/36 mosquito cells exhibited DEN3 antigenic specificity as determined by a reaction with monoclonal antibodies. Gel electrophoresis of virus-infected cell lysates yielded the predicted viral protein pattern, i.e., DEN3 C, PreM, and E and DEN4 nonstructural proteins. Two amino acid substitutions, Thr-435-->Leu and Glu-406-->Lys, which are analogous to mutations that, respectively, confer mouse neurovirulence on DEN4 and DEN2, were introduced into DEN3 E. A mutant chimera containing the Thr-435-->Leu substitution, which ablates the potential glycosylation site sequence, produced an E protein identical in size to that of wild-type DEN3 E, indicating that the glycosylation site is normally not used. Intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice revealed that the mutant chimera containing the Glu-406-->Lys substitution was neurovirulent, whereas its wild-type counterpart or parent DEN3 was not.

12359455,2002 Sep 15,Extinction and rapid emergence of strains of dengue 3 virus during an interepidemic period.,"Strains of dengue 3 (DEN-3) virus circulating in Thailand prior to 1992 appear to have disappeared from that location and to have been replaced by two new lineages which have evolved locally, rather than being introduced. Similar DEN-3 virus extinctions may have occurred previously in Thailand in 1962 and 1973. Although no causal relationship could be shown, this strain replacement event was accompanied by DEN-3 replacing DEN-2 as the serotype recovered most frequently from patients in Thailand. Although this implies a change in selection pressure, we found no evidence for positive natural selection at the level of either the E protein or the E protein gene. Further, the extinction of the pre-1992 strains and the appearance of the new lineages occurred during an interepidemic period, suggesting that a genetic bottleneck, rather than selection, might have been important in the emergence of these two new strains of virus. The pre-1992 DEN-3 virus lineage could still be found in 1998, to the west, in Myanmar. The ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide changes within a DEN-3 virus population from a single patient was less than the ratio among the consensus sequences of DEN-3 viruses from different patients, suggesting that many of the nonsynonymous nucleotide changes which occurred naturally in the E protein were deleterious and removed by purifying selection.

23110979,2012 Oct 30,Detection of dengue group viruses by fluorescence in situ hybridization.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) represent a global challenge in public health. It is estimated that 50 to 100 million infections occur each year causing approximately 20,000 deaths that are usually linked to severe cases like DHF and dengue shock syndrome. The causative agent of DF is dengue virus (genus Flavivirus) that comprises four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used successfully to detect pathogenic agents, but has not been implemented in detecting DENV. To improve our understanding of DENV infection and dissemination in host tissues, we designed specific probes to detect DENV in FISH assays. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes were designed to hybridize with RNA from the broadest range of DENV isolates belonging to the four serotypes, but not to the closest Flavivirus genomes. Three probes that fit the criteria defined for FISH experiments were selected, targeting both coding and non-coding regions of the DENV genome. These probes were tested in FISH assays against the dengue vector Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). The FISH experiments were led in vitro using the C6/36 cell line, and in vivo against dissected salivary glands, with epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The three 60-nt oligonucleotides probes DENV-Probe A, B and C cover a broad range of DENV isolates from the four serotypes. When the three probes were used together, specific fluorescent signals were observed in C6/36 infected with each DENV serotypes. No signal was detected in either cells infected with close Flavivirus members West Nile virus or yellow fever virus. The same protocol was used on salivary glands of Ae. albopictus fed with a DENV-2 infectious blood-meal which showed positive signals in the lateral lobes of infected samples, with no significant signal in uninfected mosquitoes. CONCLUSION: Based on the FISH technique, we propose a way to design and use oligonucleotide probes to detect arboviruses. Results showed that this method was successfully implemented to specifically detect DENV in a mosquito cell line, as well as in mosquito salivary glands for the DENV-2 serotype. In addition, we emphasize that FISH could be an alternative method to detect arboviruses in host tissues, also offering to circumvent the discontinuity of antibodies used in immunofluorescent assays.

23658845,2013,"Sulfated polysaccharide, curdlan sulfate, efficiently prevents entry/fusion and restricts antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection in vitro: a possible candidate for clinical application.","Curdlan sulfate (CRDS), a sulfated 1→3-β-D glucan, previously shown to be a potent HIV entry inhibitor, is characterized in this study as a potent inhibitor of the Dengue virus (DENV). CRDS was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (E) protein of the DENV. CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0.1 µg/mL in LLC-MK2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL. CRDS can also inhibit DENV-1, 3, and 4 efficiently. CRDS did not inhibit the replication of DENV subgenomic replicon. Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter. The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV-2 infection. Based on these data, a probable binding model of CRDS to DENV E protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study. The binding site of CRDS was predicted to be at the interface between domains II and III of E protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-OG binding site. Since CRDS has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, its clinical application can be considered. of Singapore, Singapore.","['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Enhancement/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dengue/*immunology', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects', 'beta-Glucans/*pharmacology']","['Curdlan sulfate (CRDS), a sulfated 1→3-β-D glucan, previously shown to be a potent HIV entry inhibitor, is characterized in this study as a potent inhibitor of the Dengue virus (DENV).', 'CRDS was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (E) protein of the DENV.', 'CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro.', 'Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0.1 µg/mL in LLC-MK2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL.', 'CRDS can also inhibit DENV-1, 3, and 4 efficiently.', 'CRDS did not inhibit the replication of DENV subgenomic replicon.', 'Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion).', 'The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter.', 'The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface.', 'CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV-2 infection.', 'Based on these data, a probable binding model of CRDS to DENV E protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study.', 'The binding site of CRDS was predicted to be at the interface between domains II and III of E protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-OG binding site.', 'Since CRDS has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, its clinical application can be considered. of Singapore, Singapore.']"
28704695,2017 Oct,Emergence of the Asian genotype of DENV-1 in South India.,"A large outbreak of dengue occurred in Tamil Nadu, South India in 2012 with 12,000 cases and CFR of 0.5%.

All four serotypes were circulating but DENV-1 was dominant, present in 52% of the serotyped samples. Furthermore, the genotype of only DENV-1 had changed; the Asian genotype had displaced the American/African.

5497897,1970 Oct,Dengue virions and antigens in brain and serum of infected mice.,"The temporal relationships of the production of infectious dengue-2 virus and its antigens were investigated in intracerebrally infected suckling mice. Infectious virus, a slowly sedimenting noninfectious hemagglutinin (SHA), and a noninfectious soluble complement-fixing antigen (SCF) were found in the brain. Serum contained high concentrations of SCF antigen relative to infectivity when compared to SCF to infectivity ratios in the brain. Degradation of virions by Tween-80 and ether produced two antigens with sedimentation characteristics similar to the noninfectious antigens occurring naturally in infected tissues. However, the virionderived SHA differed from native SHA when examined by electron microscopy and by equilibrium centrifugation in cesium chloride. Virion-derived SCF (as well as the virions and both SHA antigens) was denatured by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), whereas native SCF retained its complement-fixing activity.

30639622,2019 Jul,Emergence of new genotypes and lineages of dengue viruses during the 2012-15 epidemics in southern India.,"OBJECTIVES: To genotypically characterize dengue virus (DENV) isolates among dengue-infected children from 2012-13/2014-15 outbreaks in southern India. METHODS: Children hospitalized with suspected dengue were tested for dengue RT-PCR targeting Capsid-preMembrane (C-prM) and Envelope (Env) regions. Following virologic confirmation (n=612), a representative selection of DENV isolates (n=99) were sequenced for C-prM, aligned using ClustalW and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by maximum-likelihood method in MEGA6. RESULTS: In 2012-13 (n=113), DENV-3 (44, 38.9%) and DENV-2 (43, 38.1%) predominated; DENV-1 (22, 19.5%) and DENV-4 (1, 0.9%) were less common. The pattern changed in 2014-15 (n=499), when DENV-1 (329, 65.7%) predominated, followed by DENV-2 (97, 21.2%), DENV-3 (36, 6.7%) and DENV-4 (10, 2.0%). Multiple-serotype co-infections occurred in 2.7% and 5.4% in 2012-13 and 2014-15, respectively. Genotype III (GIII) of DENV-1 predominated (85.7%) in 2012-13, ceding to GI predominance (80.8%) in 2014-15. Among DENV-2, 71.9% (23/32) showed distinct clustering suggesting a new lineage, 'GIVc'. All tested DENV-4 were GIC, whose clustering pattern showed the emergence of two distinct clades. CONCLUSIONS: New genotypic/lineage variations in DENV-1 and DENV-2 may have influenced the magnitude and severity of dengue epidemics in southern India during this period. These findings emphasize the role of active surveillance of DENV serotypes/genotypes in aiding outbreak control and vaccine studies.

9705406,1998 Sep,Typing of dengue viruses in clinical specimens and mosquitoes by single-tube multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR.,"In recent years, dengue viruses (serotypes 1 to 4) have spread throughout tropical regions worldwide. In many places, multiple dengue virus serotypes are circulating concurrently, which may increase the risk for the more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever. For the control and prevention of dengue fever, it is important to rapidly detect and type the virus in clinical samples and mosquitoes. Assays based on reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of dengue viral RNA can offer a rapid, sensitive, and specific approach to the typing of dengue viruses. We have reduced a two-step nested RT-PCR protocol to a single-tube reaction with sensitivity equivalent to that of the two-step protocol (1 to 50 PFU) in order to maximize simplicity and minimize the risk of sample cross-contamination. This assay was also optimized for use with a thermostable RT-polymerase. We designed a plasmid-based internal control that produces a uniquely sized product and can be used to control for both reverse transcription or amplification steps without the risk of generating false-positive results. This single-tube RT-PCR procedure was used to type dengue viruses during the 1995 and 1997-1998 outbreaks in Nicaragua. In addition, an extraction procedure that permits the sensitive detection of viral RNA in pools of up to 50 mosquitoes without PCR inhibition or RNA degradation was developed. This assay should serve as a practical tool for use in countries where dengue fever is endemic, in conjunction with classical methods for surveillance and epidemiology of dengue viruses.

However, the molecular changes responsible for loss of virulence are not well characterized. This article describes the isolation and biologic attributes of one dengue 2 virulent strain as a first step to allow the study of determinants of virulence at the molecular level. METHODS: A15 dengue 2 Cuban strain was isolated from the viremic plasma of a patient with uncomplicated dengue fever during the 1981 epidemic. This was then subjected to serial passage in PDK cells. Viruses resulting from several PDK passages were compared to the parent strain for plaque size and temperature sensitivity, neurovirulence in newborn mice, and cytopathogenic effects on LLC-MK(2) and C6/36-HT cell lines. RESULTS: A15 dengue 2 Cuban strain was successfully propagated in PDK cells. Primary dog kidney 52 to 53 viruses exhibited several biologic attributes, such as small plaques, temperature sensitivity, reduced mouse neurovirulence, and cytopathic effect in permissive cell lines.

24216926,2013 Nov 4,Dengue immunoassay with an LSPR fiber optic sensor.,"Dengue fever is a viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Specific tests for dengue are not usually performed due to high costs, complicated procedures and, in some cases, long time to yield a result. For widespread use of specific tests to be possible, fast, reliable and fairly simple methods are needed. In this paper, we present a new dengue diagnostic method for the acute phase of the infection. The method proposed uses an all-optical fiber sensor based on Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) and specular reflection from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Dengue anti-NS1 antibody was immobilized on AuNPs deposited on the endface of a standard multimode fiber (62.5 µm/125 µm). The sensor is able to detect NS1 antigen at different concentrations, with limit of quantification estimated to be 0.074 μg/ml = 1.54 nM. These results indicate that the sensor could potentially be used for dengue diagnosis in the acute phase of the infection.","['Biosensing Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Dengue Virus/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Fiber Optic Technology/*instrumentation', 'Immunoassay/*instrumentation', 'Refractometry/*instrumentation', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/*instrumentation', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/analysis/immunology']","['Dengue fever is a viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide.', 'Specific tests for dengue are not usually performed due to high costs, complicated procedures and, in some cases, long time to yield a result.', 'For widespread use of specific tests to be possible, fast, reliable and fairly simple methods are needed.', 'In this paper, we present a new dengue diagnostic method for the acute phase of the infection.', 'The method proposed uses an all-optical fiber sensor based on Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) and specular reflection from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).', 'Dengue anti-NS1 antibody was immobilized on AuNPs deposited on the endface of a standard multimode fiber (62.5 µm/125 µm).', 'The sensor is able to detect NS1 antigen at different concentrations, with limit of quantification estimated to be 0.074 μg/ml = 1.54 nM.', 'These results indicate that the sensor could potentially be used for dengue diagnosis in the acute phase of the infection.']"
2016768,1991 May,Both nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3 are required for the proteolytic processing of dengue virus nonstructural proteins.,"The cleavages at the junctions of the flavivirus nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, and NS4B/NS5 share an amino acid sequence motif and are presumably catalyzed by a virus-encoded protease. We constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing various portions of the NS region of the dengue virus type 4 polyprotein. By analyzing immune precipitates of 35S-labeled lysates of recombinant virus-infected cells, we could monitor the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, and NS3/NS4A cleavages. A polyprotein composed of NS2A, NS2B, and the N-terminal 184 amino acids of NS3 was cleaved at the NS2A/NS2B and NS2B/NS3 junctions, whereas a similar polyprotein containing only the first 77 amino acids of NS3 was not cleaved. This finding is consistent with the proposal that the N-terminal 180 amino acids of NS3 constitute a protease domain. Polyproteins containing NS2A and NS3 with large in-frame deletions of NS2B were not cleaved at the NS2A/NS2B or NS2B/NS3 junctions. Coinfection with a recombinant expressing NS2B complemented these NS2B deletions for NS2B/NS3 cleavage and probably also for NS2A/NS2B cleavage. Thus, NS2B is also required for the NS2A/NS2B and NS2B/NS3 cleavages and can act in trans. Other experiments showed that NS2B was needed, apparently in cis, for NS3/NS4A cleavage and for a series of internal cleavages in NS3. Indirect evidence that NS3 can also act in trans was obtained.

21610852,2011 May,Variation in vector competence for dengue viruses does not depend on mosquito midgut binding affinity.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus genotypes of Southeast Asian origin have been associated with higher virulence and transmission compared to other genotypes of serotype 2 (DEN-2). We tested the hypothesis that genetic differences in dengue viruses may result in differential binding to the midgut of the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, resulting in increased transmission or vectorial capacity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Two strains of each of the four DEN-2 genotypes (Southeast Asian, American, Indian, and West African) were tested to determine their binding affinity for mosquito midguts from two distinct populations (Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico and McAllen, Texas, USA). Our previous studies demonstrated that Southeast Asian viruses disseminated up to 65-fold more rapidly in Ae. aegypti from Texas and were therefore more likely to be transmitted to humans. Results shown here demonstrate that viruses from all four genotypes bind to midguts at the same rate, in a titer-dependent manner. In addition, we show population differences when comparing binding affinity for DEN-2 between the Tapachula and McAllen mosquito colonies. CONCLUSIONS: If midgut binding potential is the same for all DEN-2 viruses, then viral replication differences in these tissues and throughout the mosquito can thus probably explain the significant differences in dissemination and vector competence. These conclusions differ from the established paradigms to explain mosquito barriers to infection, dissemination, and transmission.

27221214,2016 Jul,Capture of dengue viruses using antibody-integrated graphite-encapsulated magnetic beads produced using gas plasma technology.,"Despite significant advances in medicine, global health is threatened by emerging infectious diseases caused by a number of viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito‑borne virus, which can be transmitted to humans via mosquito vectors. Previously, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan reported the country's first domestically acquired case of dengue fever for almost 70 years. To address this issue, it is important to develop novel technologies for the sensitive detection of DENV. The present study reported on the development of plasma-functionalized, graphite-encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles (GrMNPs) conjugated with anti-DENV antibody for DENV capture. Radiofrequency wave‑excited inductively‑coupled Ar and ammonia gas plasmas were used to introduce amino groups onto the surface of the GrMNPs. The GrMNPs were then conjugated with an antibody against DENV, and the antibody‑integrated magnetic beads were assessed for their ability to capture DENV. Beads incubated in a cell culture medium of DENV‑infected mosquito cells were separated from the supernatant by applying a magnetic field and were then washed. The adsorption of DENV serotypes 1‑4 onto the beads was confirmed using reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction, which detected the presence of DENV genomic RNA on the GrMNPs. The methodology described in the present study, which employed the plasma-functionalization of GrMNPs to enable antibody‑integration, represents a significant improvement in the detection of DENV.

25194922,2014 Nov,Sub-genomic RNA of defective interfering (D.I.) dengue viral particles is replicated in the same manner as full length genomes.,"The predicted secondary structure of sub-genomic RNA in dengue virus defective interfering (D.I.) particles from patients, or generated in vitro, resembled that of the 3' and 5' regions of wild type dengue virus (DENV) genomes. While these structures in the sub-genomic RNA were found to be essential for its replication, their nucleotide sequences were not, so long as any new sequences maintained wild type RNA secondary structure. These observations suggested that these sub-genomic fragments of RNA from dengue viruses were replicated in the same manner as the full length genomes of their wild type, ""helper"", viruses and that they probably represent the smallest fragments of DENV RNA that can be replicated during a natural infection.

31002930,2019 Jul,Phylogenetic analysis of partial pre-membrane and envelope sequences of dengue viruses circulating in India.,"OBJECTIVE: Phylogenetic characteristics of circulating Indian dengue viruses (DENV) were analysed using partial pre-membrane (PrM) and envelope (E) sequences. An immunodominant region was analysed for mutations, and alignment with common DENV PCR primers and probes was determined. METHODS: Published Indian PrM and E DENV sequences were analysed with hitherto unpublished PrM sequences from this study site. Alignments of DENV were checked for mutations in an immunodominant region and against the commonly used PCR primers and probes. RESULTS: All four serotypes of DENV circulate in India. Genotype (G) GIII and GI of DENV-1 co-circulated in the south with significant PrM mutations before and after 2012. DENV-2 American genotype was first reported after which the Cosmopolitan genotype co-circulated with it in the southwest. The Cosmopolitan strain has been the only DENV-2 genotype circulating, although an Asian American genotype was recently reported. Significant mutations were found in the E region of DENV-2 strains. DENV-3 strains were GIII across the country. DENV-4 GI from the south and west has now spread across India. No significant mutations were found for DENV-3 or DENV-4. Indian strains showed mutations in an immunodominant region of the E gene and in the regions targeted by commonly used PCR primers and probes. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic variability of Indian DENV with co-circulation of multiple genotypes suggests that genotype surveillance is crucial to determining the composition of dengue vaccines and understanding their contribution to epidemiology, virus fitness and pathogenesis. Some mutations seen in an immunodominant region of the E gene may allow these viruses to evade host immune cells.

14671119,2004 Jan,An external loop region of domain III of dengue virus type 2 envelope protein is involved in serotype-specific binding to mosquito but not mammalian cells.,"Dengue virus (DV) is a flavivirus and infects mammalian cells through mosquito vectors. This study investigates the roles of domain III of DV type 2 envelope protein (EIII) in DV binding to the host cell. Recombinant EIII interferes with DV infection to BHK21 and C6/36 cells by blocking dengue virion adsorption to these cells. Inhibition of EIII on BHK21 cells was broad with no serotype specificity; however, inhibition of EIII on C6/36 cells was relatively serotype specific. Soluble heparin completely blocks binding of EIII to BHK21 cells, suggesting that domain III binds mainly to cell surface heparan sulfates. This suggestion is supported by the observation that EIII binds very weakly to gro2C and sog9 mutant mammalian cell lines that lack heparan sulfate. In contrast, heparin does not block binding of EIII to mosquito cells. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide that includes amino acids (aa) 380 to 389 of EIII, IGVEPGQLKL, inhibits binding of EIII to C6/36 but not BHK21 cells. This peptide corresponds to a lateral loop region on domain III of E protein, indicating a possible role of this loop in binding to mosquito cells. In summary, these results suggest that EIII plays an important role in binding of DV type 2 to host cells. In addition, EIII interacts with heparan sulfates when binding to BHK21 cells, and a loop region containing aa 380 to 389 of EIII may participate in DV type 2 binding to C6/36 cells.

22419812,2012 May,MicroRNA targeting of neurotropic flavivirus: effective control of virus escape and reversion to neurovirulent phenotype.,"Neurotropic flaviviruses can efficiently replicate in the developing and mature central nervous systems (CNS) of mice causing lethal encephalitis. Insertion of a single copy of a target for brain-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in the 3' noncoding region (3'NCR) of the flavivirus genome (chimeric tick-borne encephalitis virus/dengue virus) abolished virus neurovirulence in the mature mouse CNS. However, in the developing CNS of highly permissive suckling mice, the miRNA-targeted viruses can revert to a neurovirulent phenotype by accumulating deletions or mutations within the miRNA target sequence. Virus escape from miRNA-mediated suppression in the developing CNS was markedly diminished by increasing the number of miRNA target sites and by extending the distance between these sites in the virus genome. Insertion of multiple miRNA targets into the 3'NCR altered virus neuroinvasiveness, decreased neurovirulence and neuroinflammatory responses, and prevented neurodegeneration without loss of immunogenicity. Although the onset of encephalitis was delayed, a small number of suckling mice still succumbed to lethal intracerebral infection with the miRNA-targeted viruses. Sequence analysis of brain isolates from moribund mice revealed that the viruses escaped from miRNA-mediated suppression exclusively through the deletion of miRNA targets and viral genome sequence located between the two miRNA targets separated by the greatest distance. These findings offer a general strategy to control the reversion of virus to a virulent phenotype: a simultaneous miRNA targeting of the viral genome at many different functionally important regions could prevent virus escape from miRNA-based attenuation, since a deletion of the targeted genomic sequences located between the inserted miRNA binding sites would be lethal for the virus.

We therefore assessed the novel real-time PCR (qPCR) bCUBE (Hyris, London, UK) molecular diagnostic system as a tool for virus detection. METHODS: Aedes aegypti Rps17 was used to validate and determine correlation coefficient for the novel bCUBE qPCR system to a laboratory standard StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Experimentally infected Ae. aegypti were quantified for Zika (ZIKV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) viral genomic RNA. Infection prevalence was compared to plaque assay. RESULTS: We developed and validated a novel qPCR system for the detection of ZIKV and DENV2 using the real-time qPCR system bCUBE.

28359770,2017 Aug,Evaluation of cell viability dyes in antiviral assays with RNA viruses that exhibit different cytopathogenic properties.,"Studies were conducted to determine the performance of four dyes in assessing antiviral activities of compounds against three RNA viruses with differing cytopathogenic properties. Dyes included alamarBlue(®) measured by absorbance (ALB-A) and fluorescence (ALB-F), neutral red (NR), Viral ToxGlo™ (VTG), and WST-1. Viruses were chikungunya, dengue type 2, and Junin, which generally cause 100, 80-90, and 50% maximal cytopathic effect (CPE), respectively, in Vero or Vero 76 cells Compounds evaluated were 6-azauridine, BCX-4430, 3-deazaguanine, EICAR, favipiravir, infergen, mycophenolic acid (MPA), ribavirin, and tiazofurin. The 50% virus-inhibitory (EC(50)) values for each inhibitor and virus combination did not vary significantly based on the dye used. However, dyes varied in distinguishing the vitality of virus-infected cultures when not all cells were killed by virus infection. For example, VTG uptake into dengue-infected cells was nearly 50% when visual examination showed only 10-20% cell survival. ALB-A measured infected cell viability differently than ALB-F as follows: 16% versus 32% (dengue-infected), respectively, and 51% versus 72% (Junin-infected), respectively. Cytotoxicity (CC(50)) assays with dyes in uninfected proliferating cells produced similar CC(50) values for EICAR (1.5-8.9μM) and MPA (0.8-2.5μM). 6-Azauridine toxicity was 6.1-17.5μM with NR, VTG, and WST-1, compared to 48-92μM with ALB-A and ALB-F (P<0.001). Curiously, the CC(50) values for 3-deazaguanine were 83-93μM with ALB-F versus 2.4-7.0μM with all other dyes including ALB-A (P<0.001). Overall, ALB minimized the toxicities detected with these two inhibitors. Because the choice of dyes affected CC(50) values, this impacted on the resulting in vitro selectivity indexes (calculated as CC(50)/EC(50) ratio).

31881703,2019 Dec 25,DENV2 Pseudoviral Particles with Unprocessed Capsid Protein Are Assembled and Infectious.,"Proteolytic processing of flavivirus polyprotein is a uniquely controlled process. To date, the sequential cleavage of the capsid anchor sequence at the junction of C-PrM has been considered essential for the production of flaviviruses. In this study, we used two experimental approaches to show the effect of unprocessed capsid on the production and infectivity of dengue virus 2 (DENV2) pseudoviral particles. The results showed that (1) both mature and unprocessed capsids of DENV2 were equally efficient in the viral RNA packaging and also in the assembly of infective particles; (2) DENV2 variants, in which the viral and host mediated cleavage of Ca peptide were independent, produced significantly higher levels of infective particles. Overall, this study demonstrated that unlike other flaviviruses, DENV2 capsid does not require a cleavable Ca sequence, and the sequential cleavage is not an obligatory requirement for the morphogenesis of infective pseudoviral particles.

Our phylogenetic analysis, incorporating envelope (E) glycoprotein sequences from 147 isolates of DEN-2, provided a more complete picture of viral diversity, with a newly defined ""Cosmopolitan"" genotype having a near global distribution and two other genotypes restricted to Asia. By analyzing rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution we determined that genotypes have experienced different selection pressures, with some evidence of positive selection in the Cosmopolitan genotype and one of the two Asian genotypes, but that the transition from sylvatic to human transmission was not accompanied by adaptive evolution of the E gene. Although there was no association between selection pressures acting on the E gene and proposed virulence differences among genotypes, some putatively selected amino acid sites have previously been implicated in changing viral pathogenicity, most notably E-390, and may also affect transmittability.

28719315,2017 Jul,Analysis of Clinical and Laboratory Alterations Related to Dengue Case Severity: Comparison between Serotypes 2 and 4 in Brazil.,"The increase in severe dengue (SD) cases has caused great impact on public health and has concerned authorities of countries where the disease is endemic and epidemics reach high proportions. The recognition of progression signs of this severe disease during the initial febrile phase can be difficult, since the symptoms are often indistinguishable from other febrile diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings in patients from two dengue outbreaks and their association with the disease. The study was conducted in patients (n = 153) with signs and symptoms consistent with dengue occurred during two distinct epidemics, 2010 and 2013, in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to the 2009 World Health Organization criteria, patients were classified as dengue without warning signs ([DwoWS] 60.6%, 57/94), dengue with warning signs ([DwWS] 30.9%, 29/94), and SD (4.25%, 4/94). Patients with DwWS/SD presented lower platelet and leukocyte counts and higher transaminase levels when compared with the DwoWS ones. Interestingly, patients from the epidemic of 2010 caused by dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) had lower platelet counts than patients of the 2013 epidemic caused by DENV-4. Furthermore, plasma leakage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pleural effusion, hallmarks for a more severe disease, were also more frequently observed in those cases. Although previous studies may have extensively reported the wide range of the clinical aspects of dengue, the characterization of DENV-4 is desirable considering the burden of the disease during epidemics, especially for the health units and hospitals performing patient's management.

10365401,1999 Apr 29,Transmission dynamics and epidemiology of dengue: insights from age-stratified sero-prevalence surveys.,"The relationship between infection with the four major serotypes of dengue virus and the occurrence of different forms of disease is complex and not fully understood. Interpreting longitudinal records of the incidence of serious disease to gain insight into the transmission dynamics and epidemiology of the virus is therefore complicated. Since age reflects duration of exposure, age-stratified, strain-specific serological surveys carried out at one point in time, or over a short time interval, can potentially provide a rich source of information on longitudinal patterns. This paper describes the development and application (to data collected in Thailand) of statistically rigorous methods designed to estimate time-varying, strain-specific forces of infection, and thus basic reproduction numbers, from cross-sectional serological data. The analyses provide support for the hypothesis that antibody-dependent enhancement of transmission influences observed epidemiological pattern. Age-stratified serological data also reveal evidence of a propensity for the annual incidence of infection to oscillate over time with a frequency of several years. The latter observation is consistent with the predictions of simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of the virus. The estimates of the basic reproduction numbers obtained are similar in magnitude for each dengue serotype, being in the range of four to six. Such values are higher than those obtained from earlier analyses, and the implications of this for dengue control are discussed.

27940224,2017 Jan 15,The calmodulin antagonist W-7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride) inhibits DENV infection in Huh-7 cells.,"Dengue virus (DENV) replicative cycle occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum where calcium ions play an important role in cell signaling. Calmodulin (CaM) is the primary sensor of intracellular Ca(2+) levels in eukaryotic cells. In this paper, the effect of the calmodulin antagonist W-7 in DENV infection in Huh-7 cells was evaluated. W7 inhibited viral yield, NS1 secretion and viral RNA and protein synthesis. Moreover, luciferase activity, encoded by a DENV replicon, was also reduced. A decrease in the replicative complexes formation was clearly observed in W7 treated cells. Docking simulations suggest 2 possible mechanisms of action for W7: the direct inhibition of NS2B-NS3 activity and/or inhibition of the interaction between NS2A with Ca(2+)-CaM complex. This last possibility was supported by the in vitro interaction observed between recombinant NS2A and CaM. These results indicate that Ca(2+)-CaM plays an important role in DENV replication. 07360, Mexico.

9887321,1999 Jan 5,Rapid subtyping of dengue viruses by restriction site-specific (RSS)-PCR.,"Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide. It is caused by four dengue virus serotypes, each further divided into distinct genetic subtypes. Strain typing is important for understanding the epidemiology and viral factors associated with disease transmission. However, most of the existing subtyping methods are expensive and technically unwieldy for timely, practical applications in developing countries. Here we describe a simple, rapid, PCR-based subtyping method, restriction site-specific (RSS)-PCR, which we used to analyze dengue virus serotypes 2 and 3. For each serotype, four primers targeted to sequences spanning polymorphic endonuclease restriction sites in the envelope gene were used to reverse transcribe and amplify viral RNA. These RT-PCR products generated distinct electrophoretic band patterns for different strains. Analysis of 73 dengue-2 strains and 54 dengue-3 strains representing a broad geographic distribution over several decades revealed that the RSS-PCR fingerprints reproducibly fell into 7 and 3 groups, respectively. These groups correlated well with previous phylogenetic classifications. This one-step assay should be widely accessible and allow more detailed epidemiologic investigations in dengue-endemic countries. This novel PCR approach to subtyping organisms based on restriction site polymorphisms should be applicable to other pathogens.

16207951,2005 Oct,Serotype-specific detection of dengue viruses in a fourplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay.,"The dengue (DEN) viruses are positive-strand RNA viruses in the genus Flavivirus. Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome are important human arboviral diseases caused by infection with one of four closely related but serologically distinct DEN viruses, designated DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 viruses. All four DEN serotypes are currently co-circulating throughout the subtropics and tropics, and genotypic variation occurs among isolates within a serotype. A real-time quantitative nucleic acid amplification assay has been developed to detect viral RNA of a single DEN virus serotype. Each primer-probe set is DEN serotype specific, yet detects all genotypes in a panel of 7 to 10 representative isolates of a serotype. In single reactions and in fourplex reactions (containing four primer-probe sets in a single reaction mixture), standard dilutions of virus equivalent to 0.002 PFU of DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 viruses were detected; the limit of detection of DEN-1 virus was 0.5 equivalent PFU. Singleplex and fourplex reactions were evaluated in a panel of 40 viremic serum specimens with 10 specimens per serotype, containing 0.002 to 6,000 equivalent PFU/reaction (0.4 to 1.2 x 10(6) PFU/ml). Viral RNA was detected in all viremic serum specimens in singleplex and fourplex reactions. Thus, this serotype-specific, fourplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR nucleic acid detection assay can be used as a method for differential diagnosis of a specific DEN serotype in viremic dengue patients and as a tool for rapid identification and serotyping of DEN virus isolates.

In order to begin to understand the mechanisms of virus separation, HAp surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy after chromatography with dengue viruses. When these processes were performed without elution and with a 10-207 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient elution, dengue viruses that were adsorbed to HAp were disproportionately located in the columns. However, when eluted with a 10-600 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient, few viruses were observed on the HAp surface. After incubating the dengue viruses that were adsorbed on HAp beads at 37°C and 2°C, the sphericity of the dengue viruses were reduced with an increase in incubation temperature. These results suggested that dengue virus was adsorbed to the HAp surface by electronic interactions and could be eluted by high-salt concentration buffers, which are commonly used in protein purification. Furthermore, virus fusion was thought to occur with increasing temperature, which implied that virus-HAp adhesion was similar to virus-cell adhesion. maiko.saito@pc.hoya.co.jp","['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Ceramics/*chemistry', 'Culicidae', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Durapatite/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Temperature']","['Although ceramic hydroxyapatite (HAp) chromatography has been used as an alternative method ultracentrifugation for the production of vaccines, the mechanism of virus separation is still obscure.', 'In order to begin to understand the mechanisms of virus separation, HAp surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy after chromatography with dengue viruses.', 'When these processes were performed without elution and with a 10-207 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient elution, dengue viruses that were adsorbed to HAp were disproportionately located in the columns.', 'However, when eluted with a 10-600 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient, few viruses were observed on the HAp surface.', 'After incubating the dengue viruses that were adsorbed on HAp beads at 37°C and 2°C, the sphericity of the dengue viruses were reduced with an increase in incubation temperature.', 'These results suggested that dengue virus was adsorbed to the HAp surface by electronic interactions and could be eluted by high-salt concentration buffers, which are commonly used in protein purification.', 'Furthermore, virus fusion was thought to occur with increasing temperature, which implied that virus-HAp adhesion was similar to virus-cell adhesion.', 'maiko.saito@pc.hoya.co.jp']"
18234069,2008 Jan 30,Development and evaluation of one step single tube multiplex RT-PCR for rapid detection and typing of dengue viruses.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is emerging as a major public health concern in many parts of the world. The development of a one-step, single tube, rapid, and multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (M-RT-PCR) for simultaneous detection and typing of dengue virus using serotype specific primers during acute phase of illness is reported. RESULTS: An optimal assay condition with zero background was established having no cross-reaction with closely related members of flavivirus (Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Yellow fever) and alphavirus (Chikungunya). The feasibility of M-RT-PCR assay for clinical diagnosis was validated with 620 acute phase dengue patient sera samples of recent epidemics in India. The comparative evaluation vis a vis conventional virus isolation revealed higher sensitivity. None of the forty healthy serum samples screened in the present study revealed any amplification, thereby establishing specificity of the reported assay for dengue virus only. CONCLUSION: These findings clearly suggested that M-RT-PCR assay reported in the present study is the rapid and cost-effective method for simultaneous detection as well as typing of the dengue virus in acute phase patient serum samples. Thus, the M-RT-PCR assay developed in this study will serve as a very useful tool for rapid diagnosis and typing of dengue infections in endemic areas.

It possesses four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV 1-4). Many phylogenetic studies address particularities of the different serotypes using convenience samples that are not conducive to a spatio-temporal analysis in a single urban setting. We describe the pattern of spread of distinct lineages of DENV-3 circulating in São José do Rio Preto, Brazil, during 2006. Blood samples from patients presenting dengue-like symptoms were collected for DENV testing. We performed M-N-PCR using primers based on NS5 for virus detection and identification. The fragments were purified from PCR mixtures and sequenced. The positive dengue cases were geo-coded. To type the sequenced samples, 52 reference sequences were aligned. The dataset generated was used for iterative phylogenetic reconstruction with the maximum likelihood criterion. The best demographic model, the rate of growth, rate of evolutionary change, and Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) were estimated. The basic reproductive rate during the epidemics was estimated. We obtained sequences from 82 patients among 174 blood samples. We were able to geo-code 46 sequences. The alignment generated a 399-nucleotide-long dataset with 134 taxa. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all samples were of DENV-3 and related to strains circulating on the isle of Martinique in 2000-2001. Sixty DENV-3 from São José do Rio Preto formed a monophyletic group (lineage 1), closely related to the remaining 22 isolates (lineage 2). We assumed that these lineages appeared before 2006 in different occasions. By transforming the inferred exponential growth rates into the basic reproductive rate, we obtained values for lineage 1 of R(0) = 1.53 and values for lineage 2 of R(0) = 1.13. Under the exponential model, TMRCA of lineage 1 dated 1 year and lineage 2 dated 3.4 years before the last sampling. The possibility of inferring the spatio-temporal dynamics from genetic data has been generally little explored, and it may shed light on DENV circulation.

During the past decade a changing epidemiological pattern has been observed in Africa, with DEN outbreaks reported in all regions. In Senegal, all DENV serotypes have been reported. These important changes in the epidemiological profile of DEN are occurring in a context where there is no qualified vaccine against DEN. Further there is significant gap of knowledge on the vector bionomics and transmission dynamics in the African region to effectively prevent and control epidemics. Except for DENV-2, few studies have been performed with serotypes 1, 3, and 4, so this study was undertaken to fill out this gap. We assessed the vector competence of Aedes (Diceromyia) furcifer, Ae. (Diceromyia) taylori, Ae. (Stegomyia) luteocephalus, sylvatic and urban Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti populations from Senegal for DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 using experimental oral infection. Whole bodies and wings/legs were tested for DENV presence by cell culture assays and saliva samples were tested by real time RT-PCR to estimate infection, disseminated infection and transmission rates. Our results revealed a low capacity of sylvatic and urban Aedes mosquitoes from Senegal to transmit DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 and an impact of infection on their mortality. The highest potential transmission rate was 20% despite the high susceptibility and disseminated infection rates up to 93.7% for the 3 Ae. aegypti populations tested, and 84.6% for the sylvatic vectors Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus.

The fitness of most members within a population proved lower than the aggregate fitness of populations from which they were drawn, but lineage replacement events were not associated with changes in the distribution of fitness.

16403026,2006 Jan,Human-blind probes and primers for dengue virus identification.,"Reliable detection and identification of pathogens in complex biological samples, in the presence of contaminating DNA from a variety of sources, is an important and challenging diagnostic problem for the development of field tests. The problem is compounded by the difficulty of finding a single, unique genomic sequence that is present simultaneously in all genomes of a species of closely related pathogens and absent in the genomes of the host or the organisms that contribute to the sample background. Here we describe 'host-blind probe design'- a novel strategy of designing probes based on highly frequent genomic signatures found in the pathogen genomes of interest but absent from the host genome. Upon hybridization, an array of such informative probes will produce a unique pattern that is a genetic fingerprint for each pathogen strain. This multiprobe approach was applied to 83 dengue virus genome sequences, available in public databases, to design and perform in silico microarray experiments. The resulting patterns allow one to unequivocally distinguish the four major serotypes, and within each serotype to identify the most similar strain among those that have been completely sequenced. In an environment where dengue is indigenous, this would allow investigators to determine if a particular isolate belongs to an ongoing outbreak or is a previously circulating version. Using our probe set, the probability that misdiagnosis at the serotype level would occur is approximately 1 : 10(150). putonti@bioinfo.uh.edu","['*DNA Primers', '*DNA Probes', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['Reliable detection and identification of pathogens in complex biological samples, in the presence of contaminating DNA from a variety of sources, is an important and challenging diagnostic problem for the development of field tests.', 'The problem is compounded by the difficulty of finding a single, unique genomic sequence that is present simultaneously in all genomes of a species of closely related pathogens and absent in the genomes of the host or the organisms that contribute to the sample background.', ""Here we describe 'host-blind probe design'- a novel strategy of designing probes based on highly frequent genomic signatures found in the pathogen genomes of interest but absent from the host genome."", 'Upon hybridization, an array of such informative probes will produce a unique pattern that is a genetic fingerprint for each pathogen strain.', 'This multiprobe approach was applied to 83 dengue virus genome sequences, available in public databases, to design and perform in silico microarray experiments.', 'The resulting patterns allow one to unequivocally distinguish the four major serotypes, and within each serotype to identify the most similar strain among those that have been completely sequenced.', 'In an environment where dengue is indigenous, this would allow investigators to determine if a particular isolate belongs to an ongoing outbreak or is a previously circulating version.', 'Using our probe set, the probability that misdiagnosis at the serotype level would occur is approximately 1 : 10(150).', 'putonti@bioinfo.uh.edu']"
29868504,2018,"Complete Genome Characterization of the 2017 Dengue Outbreak in Xishuangbanna, a Border City of China, Burma and Laos.","A dengue outbreak abruptly occurred at the border of China, Myanmar, and Laos in June 2017. By November 3rd 2017, 1184 infected individuals were confirmed as NS1-positivein Xishuangbanna, a city located at the border. To verify the causative agent, complete genome information was obtained through PCR and sequencing based on the viral RNAs extracted from patient samples. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method (MEGA 6.0). Nucleotide and amino acid substitutions were analyzed by BioEdit, followed by RNA secondary structure prediction of untranslated regions (UTRs) and protein secondary structure prediction in coding sequences (CDSs). Strains YN2, YN17741, and YN176272 were isolated from local residents. Stains MY21 and MY22 were isolated from Burmese travelers. The complete genome sequences of the five isolates were 10,735 nucleotides in length. Phylogenetic analysis classified all five isolates as genotype I of DENV-1, while isolates of local residents and Burmese travelers belonged to different branches. The three locally isolates were most similar to the Dongguan strain in 2011, and the other two isolates from Burmese travelers were most similar to the Laos strain in 2008. Twenty-four amino acid substitutions were important in eight evolutionary tree branches. Comparison with DENV-1SS revealed 658 base substitutions in the local isolates, except for two mutations exclusive to YN17741, resulting in 87 synonymous mutations. Compared with the local isolates, 52 amino acid mutations occurred in the CDS of two isolates from Burmese travelers. Comparing MY21 with MY22, 17 amino acid mutations were observed, all these mutations occurred in the CDS of non-structured proteins (two in NS1, 10 in NS2, two in NS3, three in NS5). Secondary structure prediction revealed 46 changes in the potential nucleotide and protein binding sites of the CDSs in local isolates. RNA secondary structure prediction also showed base changes in the 3'UTR of local isolates, leading to two significant changes in the RNA secondary structure. To our knowledge, this study is the first complete genome analysis of isolates from the 2017 dengue outbreak that occurred at the border areas of China, Burma, and Laos.

29259329,2017 Dec 20,"Dengue viruses in Papua New Guinea: evidence of endemicity and phylogenetic variation, including the evolution of new genetic lineages.","Dengue is the most common cause of mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and is endemic in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Periodic outbreaks of dengue have been reported in Papua New Guinea (PNG), but there is only limited knowledge of its endemicity and disease burden. To help elucidate the status of the dengue viruses (DENVs) in PNG, we performed envelope (E) gene sequencing of DENV serotypes 1-4 (DENV 1-4) obtained from infected patients who traveled to Australia or from patients diagnosed during local DENV transmission events between 2001 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison with globally available DENV sequences revealed new endemic PNG lineages for DENV 1-3 which have emerged within the last decade. We also identified another possible PNG lineage for DENV-4 from 2016. The DENV-1 and 3 PNG lineages were most closely related to recent lineages circulating on Pacific island nations while the DENV-2 lineage and putative DENV-4 PNG lineage were most similar to Indonesian sequences. This study has demonstrated for the first time the co-circulation of DENV 1-4 strains in PNG and provided molecular evidence of endemic DENV transmission. Our results provide an important platform for improved surveillance and monitoring of DENVs in PNG and broaden the global understanding of DENV genetic diversity. Plains, Queensland 4108, Australia.

18367520,2008 Jun,"Microevolution of Dengue viruses circulating among primary school children in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand.","To determine the extent and structure of genetic variation in dengue viruses (DENV) on a restricted spatial and temporal scale, we sequenced the E (envelope) genes of DENV-1, -2, and -3 isolates collected in 2001 from children enrolled in a prospective school-based study in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, and diagnosed with dengue disease. Our analysis revealed substantial viral genetic variation in both time and space, with multiple viral lineages circulating within individual schools, suggesting the frequent gene flow of DENV into this microenvironment. More-detailed analyses of DENV-2 samples revealed strong clustering of viral isolates within individual schools and evidence of more-frequent viral gene flow among schools closely related in space. Conversely, we observed little evolutionary change in those viral isolates sampled over multiple time points within individual schools, indicating a low rate of mutation fixation. These results suggest that frequent viral migration into Kamphaeng Phet, coupled with population (school) subdivision, shapes the genetic diversity of DENV on a local scale, more so than in situ evolution within school catchment areas.

9601513,1998 May 10,Molecular and in vitro analysis of eight dengue type 2 viruses isolated from patients exhibiting different disease severities.,"Potential genetic determinants of dengue virulence were studied by sequencing the entire genomes of eight dengue 2 virus strains isolated from patients exhibiting different disease severities during an epidemic season in northeastern Thailand in 1993. The isolates came from one dengue shock syndrome (ThNH-7/93), three dengue hemorrhagic fever, and four dengue fever patients. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates belonged to the Southeast Asian genotype. The 3' noncoding regions showed distinctive secondary structures, with one specific structure for the isolate ThNH-7/93. Analysis of the predicted polyprotein showed several amino acid (aa) changes scattered mostly in the nonstructural region. Of 30 positions with aa changes, 7 were unique to the isolate ThNH-7/93 and 3 of those led to radical alterations in aa character. Several aa changes coincided with previous studies relating genome sequence and virulence. Minimal changes in computer-predicted protein secondary structures were observed. Infective particles in the inoculum for all isolates were approximately equal as measured by focus formation on BHK-21 cells, but this did not correlate with the number of plaques formed on LLC-MK2 cells.

34108021,2021 Jun 9,The effects of DENV serotype competition and co-infection on viral kinetics in Wolbachia-infected and uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.,"BACKGROUND: The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for the transmission of several medically important arthropod-borne viruses, including multiple serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). Competition within the mosquito between DENV serotypes can affect viral infection dynamics, modulating the transmission potential of the pathogen. Vector control remains the main method for limiting dengue fever. The insect endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis is currently being trialed in field releases globally as a means of biological control because it reduces virus replication inside the mosquito. It is not clear how co-infection between DENV serotypes in the same mosquito might alter the pathogen-blocking phenotype elicited by Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti. METHODS: Five- to 7-day-old female Ae. aegypti from two lines, namely, with (wMel) and without Wolbachia infection (WT), were fed virus-laden blood through an artificial membrane with either a mix of DENV-2 and DENV-3 or the same DENV serotypes singly. Mosquitoes were subsequently incubated inside environmental chambers and collected on the following days post-infection: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Midgut, carcass, and salivary glands were collected from each mosquito at each timepoint and individually analyzed to determine the percentage of DENV infection and viral RNA load via RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We saw that for WT mosquitoes DENV-3 grew to higher viral RNA loads across multiple tissues when co-infected with DENV-2 than when it was in a mono-infection. Additionally, we saw a strong pathogen-blocking phenotype in wMel mosquitoes independent of co-infection status. CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated that the wMel mosquito line is capable of blocking DENV serotype co-infection in a systemic way across the mosquito body. Moreover, we showed that for WT mosquitoes, serotype co-infection can affect infection frequency in a tissue- and time-specific manner and that both viruses have the potential of being transmitted simultaneously. Our findings suggest that the long-term efficacy of Wolbachia pathogen blocking is not compromised by arthropod-borne virus co-infection. Australia.

31951602,2020,Validation of the easyscreen flavivirus dengue alphavirus detection kit based on 3base amplification technology and its application to the 2016/17 Vanuatu dengue outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: The family flaviviridae and alphaviridae contain a diverse group of pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10-25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1-2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016-2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples. The assays performed well in an outbreak situation and can be used to detect positive clinical samples containing any flavivirus or alphavirus in approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.","['Base Sequence', 'Dengue/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vanuatu/epidemiology']","['BACKGROUND: The family flaviviridae and alphaviridae contain a diverse group of pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.', 'Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management.', 'Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set.', 'We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification.', 'METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays.', 'Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR.', 'The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10-25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain.', 'Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1-2 copies per reaction.', 'No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains.', 'Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide.', 'After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016-2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak.', 'Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples.', 'CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples', '.', 'The assays performed well in an outbreak situation and can be used to detect positive clinical samples containing any flavivirus or alphavirus in approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.']"
30518482,2018 Dec,"Q63, a novel DENV2 RdRp non-nucleoside inhibitor, inhibited DENV2 replication and infection.","Dengue virus (DENV) annually infects 400 million people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is lack of widely protective vaccine or drugs against DENV. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of NS5 protein is highly conserved among different DENV subtypes, thus presenting itself as an attractive target for drug design. In the current research, SPRi was performed to screen compounds against DENV2 RdRp and 5(1H)-Quinazolinone,2-(4-bromophenyl)-2,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-7,7-dimethyl-1,3-diphenyl (Q63) was successfully screened out with a KD of 0.9 μM. Then, ITC and molecular docking assay was performed to access the binding mechanism between Q63 and DENV2 RdRp. Meanwhile, Q63 also decreased the intermediate dsRNA production, which was the product of RdRp. Further the antiviral effects of Q63 were evaluated on mosquito C6/36 cells and mammalian BHK-21 cells. Q63 reduced CPE and cell toxicity effect after DENV2 infection on C6/36 and BHK-21 cells, with an EC(50) of 2.08 μM. Time of addition assay revealed that Q63 affected the early genome RNA replication stage, including genome RNA replication. In addition, Q63 down-regulated STAT1 phosphorylation, ISG15 and ISG54 after DENV2 infection. In summary, Q63 was found to be a novel RdRp non-nucleoside inhibitor and a potential lead compound for coping with DENV infectious disease in the future. reserved.

The crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment of E has been determined and compared with a previously described structure. The primary difference between these structures is a 10 degrees rotation about a hinge relating the fusion domain DII to domains DI and DIII. These two rigid body components were used for independent fitting of E into the cryo-electron microscopy maps of both immature and mature dengue viruses. The fitted E structures in these two particles showed a difference of 27 degrees between the two components. Comparison of the E structure in its postfusion state with that in the immature and mature virions shows a rotation approximately around the same hinge.

27542741,2016 Oct,Development of robust in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay as a possible platform for antiviral drug testing against dengue.,"NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein among the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. It has been the target of interest for antiviral drug development due to its major role in replication. NS5 consists of two domains, the N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature, thus affecting the inhibitor screening assays. In the current study, we expressed and purified DENV RdRp alone in Esherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The N-terminally His-tagged construct of DENV RdRp was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL-21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4mM. The induced cultures were then grown for 20h at 18°C and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000xg for 15min at 4°C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisTrap affinity column (Ni-NTA) and then the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, which successfully removed the degradation product obtained during the previous purification step. The in vitro polymerase activity of RdRp was successfully demonstrated using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid (poly(rC)) RNA template.

17502914,2007 May 9,Combinatorial computational approaches to identify tetracycline derivatives as flavivirus inhibitors.,"Limited structural information of drug targets, cellular toxicity possessed by lead compounds, and large amounts of potential leads are the major issues facing the design-oriented approach of discovering new leads. In an attempt to tackle these issues, we have developed a process of virtual screening based on the observation that conformational rearrangements of the dengue virus envelope protein are essential for the mediation of viral entry into host cells via membrane fusion. Screening was based solely on the structural information of the Dengue virus envelope protein and was focused on a target site that is presumably important for the conformational rearrangements necessary for viral entry. To circumvent the issue of lead compound toxicity, we performed screening based on molecular docking using structural databases of medical compounds. To enhance the identification of hits, we further categorized and selected candidates according to their novel structural characteristics. Finally, the selected candidates were subjected to a biological validation assay to assess inhibition of Dengue virus propagation in mammalian host cells using a plaque formation assay. Among the 10 compounds examined, rolitetracycline and doxycycline significantly inhibited plaque formation, demonstrating their inhibitory effect on dengue virus propagation. Both compounds were tetracycline derivatives with IC(50)s estimated to be 67.1 microM and 55.6 microM, respectively. Their docked conformations displayed common hydrophobic interactions with critical residues that affected membrane fusion during viral entry. These interactions will therefore position the tetracyclic ring moieties of both inhibitors to bind firmly to the target and, subsequently, disrupt conformational rearrangement and block viral entry. This process can be applied to other drug targets in which conformational rearrangement is critical to function.

23937713,2013 Aug 12,Isolation of midgut escape mutants of two American genotype dengue 2 viruses from Aedes aegypti.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that American genotype dengue 2 viruses (DENV2) have reduced viral fitness in the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, compared to other DENV2 genotypes. Diminished replication efficiency or inability to efficiently traverse membrane barriers encompassing organs such as the midgut or salivary glands are considered major factors negatively impacting viral fitness in the mosquito. RESULTS: We analyzed the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for two American DENV2 strains, QR94 and PR159 originating from Mexico and Puerto-Rico, respectively. Both strains infected mosquito midguts following acquisition of infectious bloodmeals. However, DENV2-QR94 and DENV2-PR159 poorly disseminated from the midgut at 7 or 14 days post-bloodmeal (pbm). We detected one virus isolate, EM33, among 31 DENV2-QR94 infected mosquitoes, and one isolate, EM41, among 121 DENV2-PR159 infected mosquitoes, generating high virus titers in mosquito carcasses at 7 days pbm. In oral challenge experiments, EM33 and EM41 showed midgut dissemination rates of 40-50%. Replication efficiency of EM41 in secondary mosquito tissue was similar to that of a dissemination-competent control strain, whereas the replication efficiency of EM33 was significantly lower than that of the control virus. The genome sequence of DENV2-QR94 encoded seven unique amino acids (aa), which were not found in 100 of the most closely related DENV2 strains. EM33 had one additional aa change, E202K, in the E protein. DENV2-PR159 encoded four unique aa residues, one of them E202K, whereas EM41 had two additional aa substitutions, Q77E in the E protein and E93D in NS3.

32843276,2020 Sep,Multiplex reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR for the simultaneous quantification of four dengue serotypes: Proof of concept study.,"During vaccine production, RNA from chimeric yellow fever-dengue (CYD) vaccine viruses (CYD1, CYD2, CYD3 and CYD4) is currently quantified using separate serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays. Here we describe the results from a proof-of-concept study on the development of a multiplex reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) assay for simultaneous quantification of RNA for all four viruses. Serotype-specific simplex RT-ddPCRs were developed using the serotype-specific PCR systems (forward and reverse primers and FAM (fluorescent chromophores 6-carboxyfluorescein) and YY (Yakima Yellow)-labelled probes), used in the routine RT-qPCR. The PCR systems were specific and gave similar quantification results to those from the RT-qPCR assay. Linear regression analyses were used to select relative probe concentrations to obtain distinct clusters for each target RNA in a 2-D cluster plot in a multiplex RT-ddPCR assay. We showed the clusters were positioned as predicted in the model for each CYD RNA and were well separated. The multiplex RT-ddPCR gave similar quantification results to those obtained by the serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays for triplicate samples containing 7, 8 or 9 Log10 Geq/mL.

31356638,2019 Jul,Endocytosis of flavivirus NS1 is required for NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability and is abolished by a single N-glycosylation site mutation.,"Arthropod-borne flaviviruses cause life-threatening diseases associated with endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. We recently found that vascular leak can be triggered by dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) via the disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL). However, the molecular determinants of NS1 required to trigger EGL disruption and the cellular pathway(s) involved remain unknown. Here we report that mutation of a single glycosylated residue of NS1 (N207Q) abolishes the ability of NS1 to trigger EGL disruption and induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Intriguingly, while this mutant bound to the surface of endothelial cells comparably to wild-type NS1, it was no longer internalized, suggesting that NS1 binding and internalization are distinct steps. Using endocytic pathway inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs, we determined that NS1 was endocytosed into endothelial cells in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner, which was required to trigger endothelial dysfunction in vitro and vascular leak in vivo. Finally, we found that the N207 glycosylation site is highly conserved among flaviviruses and is also essential for West Nile and Zika virus NS1 to trigger endothelial hyperpermeability via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These data provide critical mechanistic insight into flavivirus NS1-induced pathogenesis, presenting novel therapeutic and vaccine targets for flaviviral diseases.

21124880,2010 Nov 23,Viral and epidemiological determinants of the invasion dynamics of novel dengue genotypes.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue has become a major concern for international public health. Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed. METHODS/RESULTS: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype. CONCLUSION: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.","['Americas/epidemiology', 'Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Epidemics', 'Genotype', 'Humans']","['BACKGROUND: Dengue has become a major concern for international public health.', 'Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities.', 'Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology.', 'A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type.', 'Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed.', 'METHODS/RESULTS: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences', '.', 'We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence.', 'Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype.', ""CONCLUSION: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations."", ""Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.""]"

The patient had full recovery and was discharged on August 20th. The virus was isolated in C6/36 cell culture inoculated with serum collected on the 6th day after the onset of the symptoms. The serotype 3 was identified by indirect immunofluorescence assays performed with type-specific monoclonal antibodies. This serotype was further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The introduction of a new dengue serotype in a susceptible population is a real threat for the occurrence of severe forms of the disease.

19126194,2009 Jan 6,Phylogenetic studies reveal existence of multiple lineages of a single genotype of DENV-1 (genotype III) in India during 1956-2007.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) have been mostly circulating silently with dominant serotypes DENV-2 and DENV-3 in India. However recent times have marked an increase in DENV-1 circulation in yearly outbreaks. Many studies have not been carried out on this virus type, leaving a lacunae pertaining to the circulating genotypes, since its earliest report in India. In the present study, we sequenced CprM gene junction of 13 DENV-1 isolated from Delhi and Gwalior (North India) between 2001-2007 and one 1956 Vellore isolate as reference. For comparison, we retrieved 11 other Indian and 70 global reference sequences from NCBI database, making sure that Indian and global isolates from all decades are available for comparative analysis. RESULTS: The region was found to be AT rich with no insertion or deletion. Majority of the nucleotide substitutions were silent, except 3 non-conservative amino acid changes (I --> T, A --> T and L --> S at amino acid positions 59,114 and 155 respectively) in the Indian DENV-1 sequences, sequenced in this study. Except two 1997-98 Delhi isolates, which group in genotype I; all other Indian isolates group in genotype III. All Indian genotype III DENV-1 exhibited diversity among them, giving rise to at least 4 distinct lineages (India 1-4) showing proximity to isolates from diverse geographic locations.

25487800,2015 Feb,Novel dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors.,"Dengue fever is a severe, widespread, and neglected disease with more than 2 million diagnosed infections per year. The dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease (PR) represents a prime target for rational drug design. At the moment, there are no clinical PR inhibitors (PIs) available. We have identified diaryl (thio)ethers as candidates for a novel class of PIs. Here, we report the selective and noncompetitive inhibition of the serotype 2 and 3 dengue virus PR in vitro and in cells by benzothiazole derivatives exhibiting 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the low-micromolar range. Inhibition of replication of DENV serotypes 1 to 3 was specific, since all substances influenced neither hepatitis C virus (HCV) nor HIV-1 replication. Molecular docking suggests binding at a specific allosteric binding site. In addition to the in vitro assays, a cell-based PR assay was developed to test these substances in a replication-independent way. The new compounds inhibited the DENV PR with IC50s in the low-micromolar or submicromolar range in cells. Furthermore, these novel PIs inhibit viral replication at submicromolar concentrations.

22076162,2011,"Circulation of different lineages of dengue virus type 2 in Central America, their evolutionary time-scale and selection pressure analysis.","Dengue is caused by any of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to 4). Each serotype is genetically distant from the others, and each has been subdivided into different genotypes based on phylogenetic analysis. The study of dengue evolution in endemic regions is important since the diagnosis is often made by nucleic acid amplification tests, which depends upon recognition of the viral genome target, and natural occurring mutations can affect the performance of these assays. Here we report for the first time a detailed study of the phylogenetic relationships of DENV-2 from Central America, and report the first fully sequenced DENV-2 strain from Guatemala. Our analysis of the envelope (E) protein and of the open reading frame of strains from Central American countries, between 1999 and 2009, revealed that at least two lineages of the American/Asian genotype of DENV-2 have recently circulated in that region. In occasions the co-circulation of these lineages may have occurred and that has been suggested to play a role in the observed increased severity of clinical cases. Our time-scale analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor for Central American DENV-2 of the American/Asian genotype existed about 19 years ago. Finally, we report positive selection in DENV-2 from Central America in codons of the genes encoding for C, E, NS2A, NS3, and NS5 proteins.

20420715,2010 Apr 27,RNA interference modulates replication of dengue virus in Drosophila melanogaster cells.,"BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV, genus Flavivirus) has emerged as a major threat to global human health in recent decades, and novel strategies to contain the escalating dengue fever pandemic are urgently needed. RNA interference (RNAi) induced by exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has shown promise for treatment of flavivirus infections in hosts and prevention of transmission by vectors. However, the impact of RNAi triggered by authentic virus infection on replication of DENV, or any flavivirus, has received little study. The objectives of the current study were threefold: first, to assess the utility of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells for the study of DENV, second to investigate the impact of multiple enzymes in the RNAi pathway on DENV replication; and third to test for variation in the response of the four serotypes of DENV to modulation of RNAi. RESULTS: Three strains from each of the four DENV serotypes showed replication in S2 cells following infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1 and MOI 10; each strain achieved titers > 4.0 log10pfu/ml five days after infection at MOI 10. The four serotypes did not differ in mean titer. S2 cells infected with DENV-1, 2, 3 or 4 produced siRNAs, indicating that infection triggered an RNAi response. Knockdown of one of the major enzymes in the RNAi pathway, Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), resulted in a 10 to 100-fold enhancement of replication of all twelve strains of DENV in S2 cells. While serotypes did not differ in their average response to Dcr-2 knockdown, strains within serotypes showed significant differences in their sensitivity to Dcr-2 knockdown. Moreover, knockdown of three additional components of the RNAi pathway, Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), Dcr-1 and Ago-1, also resulted in a significant increase in replication of the two DENV strains tested, and the magnitude of this increase was similar to that resulting from Dcr-2 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DENV can replicate in Drosophila S2 cells and that the RNAi pathway plays a role in modulating DENV replication in these cells. S2 cells offer a useful cell culture model for evaluation of the interaction between DENV and the RNAi response.

17123982,2006 Nov,Aedes aegypti vectorial capacity is determined by the infecting genotype of dengue virus.,"Dengue viruses causing severe, hemorrhagic disease have displaced less virulent strains in the Americas during the past three decades. The American (AM) genotype of dengue serotype 2 has been endemic in the Western Hemisphere and South Pacific, causing outbreaks of dengue fever (DF), but has not been linked to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The Southeast Asian (SEA) genotype of dengue was introduced into this hemisphere in 1981, has caused outbreaks with numerous cases of DHF, and has displaced the AM genotype in several countries. We investigated the effect of viral genotype on the potential for transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in South Texas with six viruses, representing these two genotypes. Viral replication in the midgut was significantly higher in SEA-infected mosquitoes, and virus-specific proteins could be detected in salivary glands 7 days earlier in SEA- than AM-infected mosquitoes. This much earlier appearance of dengue virus in salivary glands resulted in an estimated 2- to 65-fold increase in the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes for the viruses that can cause DHF. This may be one of the mechanisms through which more virulent flaviviruses spread and displace others globally.

32868439,2020 Sep 15,Site-specific covalent labeling of large RNAs with nanoparticles empowered by expanded genetic alphabet transcription.,"Conjugation of RNAs with nanoparticles (NPs) is of significant importance because of numerous applications in biology and medicine, which, however, remains challenging especially for large ones. So far, the majority of RNA labeling relies on solid-phase chemical synthesis, which is generally limited to RNAs smaller than 100 nucleotides (nts). We, here, present an efficient and generally applicable labeling strategy for site-specific covalent conjugation of large RNAs with a gold nanoparticle (Nanogold) empowered by transcription of an expanded genetic alphabet containing the A-T/U and G-C natural base pairs (bps) and the TPT3-NaM unnatural base pair (UBP). We synthesize an amine-derivatized TPT3 (TPT3(A)), which is site specifically incorporated into a 97-nt 3'SL RNA and a 719-nt minigenomic RNA (DENV-mini) from Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) by in vitro T7 transcription. The TPT3(A)-modified RNAs are covalently conjugated with mono-Sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS)-Nanogold NPs via an amine and NHS ester reaction and further purified under nondenaturing conditions. TPT3 modification and Nanogold labeling cause minimal structural perturbations to the RNAs by circular dichroism, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and binding activity assay. We demonstrate the application of the Nanogold-RNA conjugates in large RNA structural biology by an emerging molecular ruler, X-ray scattering interferometry (XSI). The internanoparticle distance distributions in the 3'SL and DENV-mini RNAs derived from XSI measurements support the hypothetical model of flavivirus genome circularization, thus, validate the applicability of this labeling strategy. The presented strategy overcomes the size constraints in conventional RNA labeling strategies and is expected to have wide applications in large RNA structural biology and RNA nanotechnology.

30180800,2018 Sep 4,Application of whole genome data for in silico evaluation of primers and probes routinely employed for the detection of viral species by RT-qPCR using dengue virus as a case study.,"BACKGROUND: Viral infection by dengue virus is a major public health problem in tropical countries. Early diagnosis and detection are increasingly based on quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) directed against genomic regions conserved between different isolates. Genetic variation can however result in mismatches of primers and probes with their targeted nucleic acid regions. Whole genome sequencing allows to characterize and track such changes, which in turn enables to evaluate, optimize, and (re-)design novel and existing RT-qPCR methods. The immense amount of available sequence data renders this however a labour-intensive and complex task. RESULTS: We present a bioinformatics approach that enables in silico evaluation of primers and probes intended for routinely employed RT-qPCR methods. This approach is based on analysing large amounts of publically available whole genome data, by first employing BLASTN to mine the genomic regions targeted by the RT-qPCR method(s), and afterwards using BLASTN-SHORT to evaluate whether primers and probes will anneal based on a set of simple in silico criteria. Using dengue virus as a case study, we evaluated 18 published RT-qPCR methods using more than 3000 publically available genomes in the NCBI Virus Variation Resource, and provide a systematic overview of method performance based on in silico sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive overview of dengue virus RT-qPCR method performance that will aid appropriate method selection allowing to take specific measures that aim to contain and prevent viral spread in afflicted regions. Notably, we find that primer-template mismatches at their 3' end may represent a general issue for dengue virus RT-qPCR detection methods that merits more attention in their development process. Our approach is also available as a public tool, and demonstrates how utilizing genomic data can provide meaningful insights in an applied public health setting such as the detection of viral species in human diagnostics. kevin.vanneste@sciensano.be. nancy.roosens@sciensano.be.

27865829,2017 Jan,"Trend and geographic analysis of the prevalence of dengue in Taiwan, 2010-2015.","BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most rapidly spreading disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus in the world. The incidence of dengue globally has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years. Understanding the prevalence of dengue and its longitudinal trends can improve prevention and control strategies. This study assessed the trends in prevalence of dengue in Taiwan by population characteristics and geographical region. METHODS: Dengue and population data for the years 2010-2015 were obtained from the public statistics databases of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Department of Statistics, Taiwan Ministry of Interior. Yearly prevalence rates of dengue were calculated by age group, sex, and administrative area within five geographic regions (northern, mid-western, southern, and eastern regions, and outer islands). RESULTS: The national prevalence rate of dengue decreased gradually from 8 to 4 per 100000 population between 2010 and 2013, but it increased substantially in 2014 and 2015 to 67 and 187 per 100000 population, respectively. There was no significant difference in prevalence rate between males and females. People aged 60-69 years had a significantly higher prevalence rate than those in the other age groups during 2010-2014, and people aged over 70 years had the highest rate in 2015 (309 per 100000 population). The southern region had the highest yearly dengue prevalence rate (the rate decreased from 23 to 9 per 100000 population between 2010 and 2013, but increased to 220 and 616 per 100000 population in 2014 and 2015, respectively). Three unexpected outbreaks of dengue were observed during the study period: the first outbreak occurred in Penghu County in 2011 (prevalence rate 101 per 100000 population), the second in Kaohsiung City in 2014 (prevalence rate 540 per 100000 population), and the third in Tainan City in 2015 (prevalence rate 1208 per 100000 population). CONCLUSIONS: More efforts are still needed to prevent and control dengue in Taiwan. The government should direct resources and interventions to southern Taiwan, which has a tropical climate and a high population density, and should target older people who are more likely to be infected. Strategies are also needed to respond quickly to unexpected incidents to prevent dengue outbreaks.

31821892,2020 Feb,"Re-emergence of dengue virus serotype 3 infections in Gabon in 2016-2017, and evidence for the risk of repeated dengue virus infections.","OBJECTIVES: Dengue outbreaks, mainly caused by dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), occurred in 2007 and in 2010 in Gabon, Central Africa. However, information on DENV infections has been insufficient since 2010. The aim of this study was to investigate the current DENV infection scenario and the risk of repeated infections in Gabon. METHODS: During 2015-2017, serum samples were collected from enrolled febrile participants and were tested for DENV infection using RT-qPCR. DENV-positive samples were analyzed for a history of previous DENV infection(s) using ELISA. The complete DENV genome was sequenced to analyze the phylogeny of Gabonese DENV strains. RESULTS: DENV-3 was exclusively detected, with a high rate of anti-DENV IgG seropositivity among DENV-3-positive participants. DENV-3 showed higher infection rates in adults and the infection was seasonal with peaks in the rainy seasons. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gabonese DENV-3 originated from West African strains and has been circulating continuously in Gabon since at least 2010, when the first DENV-3 case was reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate stable DENV-3 circulation and the risk of repeated DENV infections in Gabon, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring to control DENV infections.

26395339,2015 Sep 22,Introduction and evolution of dengue virus type 2 in Pakistan: a phylogeographic analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Pattern of Dengue periodic epidemics through the years along with sporadic cases of Dengue hemorrhagic fever followed by a severe 2011 epidemic of Dengue fever in Pakistan make Pakistan a Dengue endemic country. To study the entry and evolution of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) in Pakistan, we sequenced three full length genomes and 24 complete envelope sequences of DENV-2 from the years 2010, 2011 and 2013 collected from Punjab province of Pakistan. METHODS: Phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analyses was applied to three full genome sequences as well as 24 envelope sequences to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of DENV-2 in Pakistan. RESULTS: Most of the DENV-2 viruses from the years 2008 to 2013 formed a monophyletic Pakistani clade in IVb sublineage of cosmopolitan genotype except one 2008 DENV-2 strain. Phylogeographic analysis revealed that this 2008 DENV-2 strain was rooted to India 25.4 years ago with a location probability of 0.88. However Pakistani clade rooted back to Sri Lanka 12.6 years ago with a location probability of 0.57. CONCLUSION: DENV-2 genotype IV was introduced in Pakistan in two time events. First event was introduction from India to Pakistan in the late 1980s (around 1986), and second event was introduction from Sri Lanka to Pakistan around 2000. The later introduction event was responsible for major outbreaks in the Punjab region of Pakistan, including major 2011 outbreak. After the second Introduction event, DENV-2 circulated locally in the region forming a distinct Sublineage within the IVb cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2. University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.

21775958,2011 Jul 9,Visualizing dengue virus through Alexa Fluor labeling.,"The early events in the interaction between virus and cell can have profound influence on the outcome of infection. Determining the factors that influence this interaction could lead to improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and thus influence vaccine or therapeutic design. Hence, the development of methods to probe this interaction would be useful. Recent advancements in fluorophores development and imaging technology can be exploited to improve our current knowledge on dengue pathogenesis and thus pave the way to reduce the millions of dengue infections occurring annually. The enveloped dengue virus has an external scaffold consisting of 90 envelope glycoprotein (E) dimers protecting the nucleocapsid shell, which contains a single positive strand RNA genome. The identical protein subunits on the virus surface can thus be labeled with an amine reactive dye and visualized through immunofluorescent microscopy. Here, we present a simple method of labeling of dengue virus with Alexa Fluor succinimidyl ester dye dissolved directly in a sodium bicarbonate buffer that yielded highly viable virus after labeling. There is no standardized procedure for the labeling of live virus and existing manufacturer's protocol for protein labeling usually requires the reconstitution of dye in dimethyl sulfoxide. The presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, even in minute quantities, can block productive infection of virus and also induce cell cytotoxicity. The exclusion of the use of dimethyl sulfoxide in this protocol thus reduced this possibility. Alexa Fluor dyes have superior photostability and are less pH-sensitive than the common dyes, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, making them ideal for studies on cellular uptake and endosomal transport of the virus. The conjugation of Alexa Fluor dye did not affect the recognition of labeled dengue virus by virus-specific antibody and its putative receptors in host cells. This method could have useful applications in virological studies.","['Dengue Virus/*chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Organic Chemicals/chemistry', 'Virology/*methods']","['The early events in the interaction between virus and cell can have profound influence on the outcome of infection.', 'Determining the factors that influence this interaction could lead to improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and thus influence vaccine or therapeutic design.', 'Hence, the development of methods to probe this interaction would be useful.', 'Recent advancements in fluorophores development and imaging technology can be exploited to improve our current knowledge on dengue pathogenesis and thus pave the way to reduce the millions of dengue infections occurring annually.', 'The enveloped dengue virus has an external scaffold consisting of 90 envelope glycoprotein (E) dimers protecting the nucleocapsid shell, which contains a single positive strand RNA genome.', 'The identical protein subunits on the virus surface can thus be labeled with an amine reactive dye and visualized through immunofluorescent microscopy.', 'Here, we present a simple method of labeling of dengue virus with Alexa Fluor succinimidyl ester dye dissolved directly in a sodium bicarbonate buffer that yielded highly viable virus after labeling.', ""There is no standardized procedure for the labeling of live virus and existing manufacturer's protocol for protein labeling usually requires the reconstitution of dye in dimethyl sulfoxide."", 'The presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, even in minute quantities, can block productive infection of virus and also induce cell cytotoxicity.', 'The exclusion of the use of dimethyl sulfoxide in this protocol thus reduced this possibility.', 'Alexa Fluor dyes have superior photostability and are less pH-sensitive than the common dyes, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, making them ideal for studies on cellular uptake and endosomal transport of the virus.', 'The conjugation of Alexa Fluor dye did not affect the recognition of labeled dengue virus by virus-specific antibody and its putative receptors in host cells.', 'This method could have useful applications in virological studies.']"
17215345,2007 Mar,Cost-effective real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to screen for Dengue virus followed by rapid single-tube multiplex RT-PCR for serotyping of the virus.,"Virus detection methodology provides detection of dengue virus in the early phase of the disease. PCR, targeting cDNA derived from viral RNA, has been used as a laboratory-based molecular tool for the detection of Dengue virus. We report the development and use of three real-time one-step reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect dengue cases and serotype the virus involved. The first RT-PCR assay uses SYBR green I as the reporting dye for the purpose of cost-effective screening for dengue virus. The detection limit of the SYBR green I assay was 10 PFU/ml (0.01 equivalent PFU per assay) for all four dengue virus serotypes. The second RT-PCR assay is a duplex fluorogenic probe-based real-time RT-PCR for serotyping clinical samples for dengue viruses. The detection threshold of the probe-based RT-PCR format was 0.1 PFU for serotypes Dengue-1 and Dengue-2, 1 PFU for serotype Dengue-3, and 0.01 PFU for serotype Dengue-4. The third is a fourplex assay that detects any of the four serotypes in a single closed tube with comparable sensitivity. Validation of the assays with local clinical samples collected from 2004 to 2006 revealed that there was an 88% positive correlation between virus isolation and RT-PCR with regard to dengue virus detection and a 100% correlation with seroconversion in subsequent samples.

Most of the virtual screening methods in flaviviral drug discovery suffer from a low hit rate, strain-specific efficacy differences, and susceptibility to resistance. It is because they often fail to capture the key pharmacological features of the target active site critical for protein function inhibition. So in our current work, for the flaviviral NS3 protease, we summarized the pharmacophore features at the protease active site as anchors (subsite-moiety interactions). RESULTS: For each of the four flaviviral NS3 proteases (i.e., HCV, DENV, WNV, and JEV), the anchors were obtained and summarized into 'Pharmacophore anchor (PA) models'. To capture the conserved pharmacophore anchors across these proteases, were merged the four PA models. We identified five consensus core anchors (CEH1, CH3, CH7, CV1, CV3) in all PA models, represented as the ""Core pharmacophore anchor (CPA) model"" and also identified specific anchors unique to the PA models. Our PA/CPA models complied with 89 known NS3 protease inhibitors. Furthermore, we proposed an integrated anchor-based screening method using the anchors from our models for discovering inhibitors. This method was applied on the DENV NS3 protease to screen FDA drugs discovering boceprevir, telaprevir and asunaprevir as promising anti-DENV candidates. Experimental testing against DV2-NGC virus by in-vitro plaque assays showed that asunaprevir and telaprevir inhibited viral replication with EC(50) values of 10.4 μM & 24.5 μM respectively. The structure-anchor-activity relationships (SAAR) showed that our PA/CPA model anchors explained the observed in-vitro activities of the candidates. Also, we observed that the CEH1 anchor engagement was critical for the activities of telaprevir and asunaprevir while the extent of inhibitor anchor occupation guided their efficacies. CONCLUSION: These results validate our NS3 protease PA/CPA models, anchors and the integrated anchor-based screening method to be useful in inhibitor discovery and lead optimization, thus accelerating flaviviral drug discovery. 115, Taiwan.

Guangzhou has the ideal environment for DENV transmission and DENV epidemics have been reported in this region for more than 30 years. METHODS: Information for DENV infection cases in Guangzhou from 2001 to 2010 were collected and analyzed. The DENV strains were cultured and isolated from patients' sera. Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription PCR. Phylogenetic trees of four DENV serotypes were constructed respectively. RESULTS: In total, 2478 DENV infection cases were reported; 2143 of these (86.43%) occurred during 3 months of the year: August, September and October. Of these, 2398 were local cases (96.77%) and 80 were imported cases (3.23%). Among the imported cases, 69 (86.25%) were from Southeast Asian countries. From the 90 isolated strains, 66.67%, 3.33%, 14.44%, and 15.56% belonged to DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

22417684,2012 May 1,Ivermectin is a specific inhibitor of importin α/β-mediated nuclear import able to inhibit replication of HIV-1 and dengue virus.,"The movement of proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus mediated by the importin superfamily of proteins is essential to many cellular processes, including differentiation and development, and is critical to disease states such as viral disease and oncogenesis. We recently developed a high-throughput screen to identify specific and general inhibitors of protein nuclear import, from which ivermectin was identified as a potential inhibitor of importin α/β-mediated transport. In the present study, we characterized in detail the nuclear transport inhibitory properties of ivermectin, demonstrating that it is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of importin α/β nuclear import, with no effect on a range of other nuclear import pathways, including that mediated by importin β1 alone. Importantly, we establish for the first time that ivermectin has potent antiviral activity towards both HIV-1 and dengue virus, both of which are strongly reliant on importin α/β nuclear import, with respect to the HIV-1 integrase and NS5 (non-structural protein 5) polymerase proteins respectively.

23516646,2013,Twenty years of DENV-2 activity in Brazil: molecular characterization and phylogeny of strains isolated from 1990 to 2010.,"In Brazil, dengue has been a major public health problem since its introduction in the 1980s. Phylogenetic studies constitute a valuable tool to monitor the introduction and spread of viruses as well as to predict the potential epidemiological consequences of such events. Aiming to perform the molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of DENV-2 during twenty years of viral activity in the country, viral strains isolated from patients presenting different disease manifestations (n = 34), representing six states of the country, from 1990 to 2010, were sequenced. Partial genome sequencing (genes C/prM/M/E) was performed in 25 DENV-2 strains and full-length genome sequencing (coding region) was performed in 9 strains. The percentage of similarity among the DENV-2 strains in this study and reference strains available in Genbank identified two groups epidemiologically distinct: one represented by strains isolated from 1990 to 2003 and one from strains isolated from 2007 to 2010. No consistent differences were observed on the E gene from strains isolated from cases with different clinical manifestations analyzed, suggesting that if the disease severity has a genetic origin, it is not only due to the differences observed on the E gene. The results obtained by the DENV-2 full-length genome sequencing did not point out consistent differences related to a more severe disease either. The analysis based on the partial and/or complete genome sequencing has characterized the Brazilian DENV-2 strains as belonging to the Southeast Asian genotype, however a distinction of two Lineages within this genotype has been identified. It was established that strains circulating prior DENV-2 emergence (1990-2003) belong to Southeast Asian genotype, Lineage I and strains isolated after DENV-2 emergence in 2007 belong to Southeast Asian genotype, Lineage II. Furthermore, all DENV-2 strains analyzed presented an asparagine (N) in E390, previously identified as a probable genetic marker of virulence observed in DHF strains from Asian origin. The percentage of identity of the latter with the Dominican Republic strain isolated in 2001 combined to the percentage of divergence with the strains first introduced in the country in the 1990s suggests that those viruses did not evolve locally but were due to a new viral Lineage introduction in the country from the Caribbean.

28622093,2017 Nov 17,Suppressive effect of dengue virus envelope protein domain III on megakaryopoiesis.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause severe, life-threatening events, and no specific treatments of DENV infection are currently approved. Although thrombocytopenia is frequently observed in dengue patients, its pathogenesis is still not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia occurs through viral-replication-mediated megakaryopoiesis inhibition in the bone marrow; however, the exact mechanism for megakaryopoiesis suppression remains elusive. In this study, a reductionist approach was applied, in which C57B/6J mice were inoculated with recombinant DENV-envelope protein domain III (DENV-EIII) instead of the full viral particle. Our results demonstrated that DENV-EIII-suppressed megakaryopoiesis is similar to those observed with DENV infection. Furthermore, in agreement with our in vivo analyses, DENV-EIII sufficiently suppressed the megakaryopoiesis of progenitor cells from murine bone marrow and human cord blood in vitro. Additional analyses suggested that autophagy impairment and apoptosis are involved in DENV-EIII-mediated suppression of megakaryopoiesis. These data suggest that, even without viral replication, the binding of DENV-EIII to the cell surface is sufficient to suppress megakaryopoiesis. Hualien , Taiwan. Hualien , Taiwan. Hualien , Taiwan.

26536458,2015,"Phylogenetic and Molecular Clock Analysis of Dengue Serotype 1 and 3 from New Delhi, India.","Dengue fever is the most prevalent arboviral disease in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. The present report describes molecular detection and serotyping of dengue viruses in acute phase blood samples collected from New Delhi, India. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis of dengue virus serotype 1 and 3 strains were also investigated. Dengue virus infection was detected in 68.87% out of 604 samples tested by RT-PCR between 2011 & 2014. Dengue serotype 1 was detected in 25.48% samples, dengue serotype 2 in 79.56% samples and dengue serotype 3 in 11.29% samples. Dengue serotype 4 was not detected. Co-infection by more than one dengue serotype was detected in 18.26% samples. Envelope gene of 29 DENV-1 and 14 DENV-3 strains were sequenced in the study. All the DENV-1 strains grouped with the American African genotype. All DENV-3 strains were found to belong to Genotype III. Nucleotide substitution rates of dengue 1 and 3 viruses were determined in the study. Time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of dengue 1 viruses was determined to be 132 years. TMRCA of DENV-3 viruses was estimated to be 149 years.

21813012,2011 Aug 3,"First report of multiple lineages of dengue viruses type 1 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","BACKGROUND: In Brazil dengue has been a major public health problem since DENV-1 introduction and spread in 1986. After a low or silent co-circulation, DENV-1 re-emerged in 2009 causing a major epidemic in the country in 2010 and 2011. In this study, the phylogeny of DENV-1 strains isolated in RJ after its first introduction in 1986 and after its emergence in 2009 and 2010 was performed in order to document possible evolutionary patterns or introductions in a re-emergent virus. FINDINGS: The analysis of the E gene sequences demonstrated that DENV-1 isolated during 2009/2010 still belong to genotype V (Americas/Africa) but grouping in a distinct clade (lineage II) of that represented by earlier DENV-1 (lineage I). However, strains isolated in 2011 grouped together forming another distinct clade (lineage III). CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of DENV is important to observe the spread of potentially virulent strains as well to evaluate its impact over the population during an outbreak. Whether explosive epidemics reported in Brazil caused mainly by DENV-1 was due to lineage replacement, or due the population susceptibility to this serotype which has not circulated for almost a decade or even due to the occurrence of secondary infections in a hyperendemic country, is not clear.

23110744,2013 Sep,Diversity and composition of dengue virus type 2 in Venezuela.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four closely related dengue virus (genus Flavivirus)serotypes (DENV-1–4). The clinical outcomes vary from mild febrile illness to life-threatening haemorrhagic manifestations. DENVs are endemic in the tropics and subtropics globally and currently no specific treatment or vaccines are available. In Venezuela, the American-Asian genotype of DENV-2 is the most prevalent and has been associated with severe disease outcomes.We aimed to follow-up the molecular epidemiology of DENV-2 in Venezuela to investigate if the evolution of the virus has remained the same throughout time or if the same dynamics documented in Brazil (hyperendemic co-circulation) also occurred. The results show that whereas the epidemiology of DENV in several endemic areas is characterized by serotype replacements through time, in Venezuela the American-Asian genotype DENV-2 has evolved into several genetic lineages and has remained in hyperendemic co-circulation with the other serotypes.

14528291,2003 Nov,Visualization of membrane protein domains by cryo-electron microscopy of dengue virus.,"Improved technology for reconstructing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images has now made it possible to determine secondary structural features of membrane proteins in enveloped viruses. The structure of mature dengue virus particles was determined to a resolution of 9.5 A by cryo-EM and image reconstruction techniques, establishing the secondary structural disposition of the 180 envelope (E) and 180 membrane (M) proteins in the lipid envelope. The alpha-helical 'stem' regions of the E molecules, as well as part of the N-terminal section of the M proteins, are buried in the outer leaflet of the viral membrane. The 'anchor' regions of E and the M proteins each form antiparallel E-E and M-M transmembrane alpha-helices, leaving their C termini on the exterior of the viral membrane, consistent with the predicted topology of the unprocessed polyprotein. This is one of only a few determinations of the disposition of transmembrane proteins in situ and shows that the nucleocapsid core and envelope proteins do not have a direct interaction in the mature virus.

33575893,2021 Apr,Molecular evolution of dengue virus types 1 and 4 in Korean travelers.,"Dengue virus (DV) is a mosquito-borne virus that is endemic to many tropical and subtropical areas. Recently, the annual incidence of DV infection has increased worldwide, including in Korea, due to global warming and increased global travel. We therefore sought to characterize the molecular and evolutionary features of DV-1 and DV-4 isolated from Korean overseas travelers. We used phylogenetic analysis based on the full coding region to classify isolates of DV-1 in Korea into genotype I (43251, KP406802), genotype IV (KP406803), and genotype V (KP406801). In addition, we found that strains of DV-4 belonged to genotype I (KP406806) and genotype II (43257). Evidence of positive selection in DV-1 strains was identified in the C, prM, NS2A, and NS5 proteins, whereas DV-4 showed positive selection only in the non-structural proteins NS2A, NS3, and NS5. The substitution rates per site per year were 5.58 × 10(-4) and 6.72 × 10(-4) for DV-1 and DV-4, respectively, and the time of the most recent common ancestor was determined using the Bayesian skyline coalescent method. In this study, the molecular, phylogenetic, and evolutionary characteristics of Korean DV-1 and DV-4 isolates were evaluated for the first time. Biotechnology, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.

27618709,2016 Sep,DenHunt - A Comprehensive Database of the Intricate Network of Dengue-Human Interactions.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a human pathogen and its etiology has been widely established. There are many interactions between DENV and human proteins that have been reported in literature. However, no publicly accessible resource for efficiently retrieving the information is yet available. In this study, we mined all publicly available dengue-human interactions that have been reported in the literature into a database called DenHunt. We retrieved 682 direct interactions of human proteins with dengue viral components, 382 indirect interactions and 4120 differentially expressed human genes in dengue infected cell lines and patients. We have illustrated the importance of DenHunt by mapping the dengue-human interactions on to the host interactome and observed that the virus targets multiple host functional complexes of important cellular processes such as metabolism, immune system and signaling pathways suggesting a potential role of these interactions in viral pathogenesis. We also observed that 7 percent of the dengue virus interacting human proteins are also associated with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Finally, the understanding that comes from such analyses could be used to design better strategies to counteract the diseases caused by dengue virus.

20668540,2010 Jul 27,Phylogeography of recently emerged DENV-2 in southern Viet Nam.,"Revealing the dispersal of dengue viruses (DENV) in time and space is central to understanding their epidemiology. However, the processes that shape DENV transmission patterns at the scale of local populations are not well understood, particularly the impact of such factors as human population movement and urbanization. Herein, we investigated trends in the spatial dynamics of DENV-2 transmission in the highly endemic setting of southern Viet Nam. Through a phylogeographic analysis of 168 full-length DENV-2 genome sequences obtained from hospitalized dengue cases from 10 provinces in southern Viet Nam, we reveal substantial genetic diversity in both urban and rural areas, with multiple lineages identified in individual provinces within a single season, and indicative of frequent viral migration among communities. Focusing on the recently introduced Asian I genotype, we observed particularly high rates of viral exchange between adjacent geographic areas, and between Ho Chi Minh City, the primary urban center of this region, and populations across southern Viet Nam. Within Ho Chi Minh City, patterns of DENV movement appear consistent with a gravity model of virus dispersal, with viruses traveling across a gradient of population density. Overall, our analysis suggests that Ho Chi Minh City may act as a source population for the dispersal of DENV across southern Viet Nam, and provides further evidence that urban areas of Southeast Asia play a primary role in DENV transmission. However, these data also indicate that more rural areas are also capable of maintaining virus populations and hence fueling DENV evolution over multiple seasons.

16873905,2006 May,Diagnostic methods for detection & isolation of dengue viruses from vector mosquitoes.,"Dengue is a deadly mosquito-borne infection warranting urgent attention for its containment particularly in the tropical and subtropical countries. In the absence of a vaccine or any specific drug for its treatment, an early diagnosis is considered indispensable to prevent any casualty. Detection of viruses in human sera particularly in endemic areas is cumbersome, difficult and also not desirable. Therefore, as an alternative approach, detection of the dengue virus antigen in mosquitoes has provided a reliable tool to (i) comprehend the types of viruses circulating in nature; and (ii) help in designing vector-specific control strategies. A mélange of diagnostic techniques are currently available with some advantages or disadvantages. Traditionally, cell cultures and suckling mice have been employed for virus isolations. While the virus isolation method in baby mice is time consuming, slow and expensive, the mosquito cell cultures offer a good degree of specificity. Mosquito inoculation techniques have been reported for detection and propagation of flaviviruses. Though this technique is sensitive for routine virological confirmation of dengue fever, it requires large number of infected mosquitoes, besides being time consuming. Insect bioassays (Toxo-IFA) are generally cumbersome requiring special facilities and are not suitable for large-scale epidemiological surveillance. ELISA has been shown to be a rapid and sensitive alternative to insect bioassays for monitoring arboviruses in wild populations. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a recent molecular diagnostic technology used for detecting virus infections in mosquitoes, which gives rapid results but is expensive and prone to contamination. This review describes the development of various techniques involved in detection and isolation of dengue viruses in mosquitoes. Definite diagnosis of the impending dengue epidemic can be made using ELISA for virological surveillance system on dengue virus antigen in the mosquito vectors. Therefore, ELISA offers a potential tool and a convenient system for quickly screening large number of samples up to the serotype level which can be employed effectively and efficiently for large scale dengue surveillance programmes on wild caught mosquito vectors. ELISA positive samples can be screened further by Toxo-IFA system for virus isolation. On the other hand, techniques like mosquitoes cell culture, mosquito inoculation (Toxo-IFA) and RT-PCR techniques can be employed for dengue virus amplification. crmeicmr@icmr.org.in","['Aedes/*virology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Culex', 'Dengue/transmission', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors/*virology', 'Mice', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Virus Cultivation']","['Dengue is a deadly mosquito-borne infection warranting urgent attention for its containment particularly in the tropical and subtropical countries.', 'In the absence of a vaccine or any specific drug for its treatment, an early diagnosis is considered indispensable to prevent any casualty.', 'Detection of viruses in human sera particularly in endemic areas is cumbersome, difficult and also not desirable.', 'Therefore, as an alternative approach, detection of the dengue virus antigen in mosquitoes has provided a reliable tool to (i) comprehend the types of viruses circulating in nature; and (ii) help in designing vector-specific control strategies.', 'A mélange of diagnostic techniques are currently available with some advantages or disadvantages.', 'Traditionally, cell cultures and suckling mice have been employed for virus isolations.', 'While the virus isolation method in baby mice is time consuming, slow and expensive, the mosquito cell cultures offer a good degree of specificity.', 'Mosquito inoculation techniques have been reported for detection and propagation of flaviviruses.', 'Though this technique is sensitive for routine virological confirmation of dengue fever, it requires large number of infected mosquitoes, besides being time consuming.', 'Insect bioassays (Toxo-IFA) are generally cumbersome requiring special facilities and are not suitable for large-scale epidemiological surveillance.', 'ELISA has been shown to be a rapid and sensitive alternative to insect bioassays for monitoring arboviruses in wild populations.', 'Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a recent molecular diagnostic technology used for detecting virus infections in mosquitoes, which gives rapid results but is expensive and prone to contamination.', 'This review describes the development of various techniques involved in detection and isolation of dengue viruses in mosquitoes.', 'Definite diagnosis of the impending dengue epidemic can be made using ELISA for virological surveillance system on dengue virus antigen in the mosquito vectors.', 'Therefore, ELISA offers a potential tool and a convenient system for quickly screening large number of samples up to the serotype level which can be employed effectively and efficiently for large scale dengue surveillance programmes on wild caught mosquito vectors.', 'ELISA positive samples can be screened further by Toxo-IFA system for virus isolation.', 'On the other hand, techniques like mosquitoes cell culture, mosquito inoculation (Toxo-IFA) and RT-PCR techniques can be employed for dengue virus amplification.', 'crmeicmr@icmr.org.in']"
16882970,2006 Aug 15,A 5' RNA element promotes dengue virus RNA synthesis on a circular genome.,"The mechanisms of RNA replication of plus-strand RNA viruses are still unclear. Here, we identified the first promoter element for RNA synthesis described in a flavivirus. Using dengue virus as a model, we found that the viral RdRp discriminates the viral RNA by specific recognition of a 5' element named SLA. We demonstrated that RNA-RNA interactions between 5' and 3' end sequences of the viral genome enhance dengue virus RNA synthesis only in the presence of an intact SLA. We propose a novel mechanism for minus-strand RNA synthesis in which the viral polymerase binds SLA at the 5' end of the genome and reaches the site of initiation at the 3' end via long-range RNA-RNA interactions. These findings provide an explanation for the strict requirement of dengue virus genome cyclization during viral replication.","['Dengue Virus/*genetics/physiology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid/*physiology', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']","['The mechanisms of RNA replication of plus-strand RNA viruses are still unclear.', 'Here, we identified the first promoter element for RNA synthesis described in a flavivirus.', ""Using dengue virus as a model, we found that the viral RdRp discriminates the viral RNA by specific recognition of a 5' element named SLA."", ""We demonstrated that RNA-RNA interactions between 5' and 3' end sequences of the viral genome enhance dengue virus RNA synthesis only in the presence of an intact SLA."", ""We propose a novel mechanism for minus-strand RNA synthesis in which the viral polymerase binds SLA at the 5' end of the genome and reaches the site of initiation at the 3' end via long-range RNA-RNA interactions."", 'These findings provide an explanation for the strict requirement of dengue virus genome cyclization during viral replication.']"

This study aimed to i) identify laboratory markers that can be used to predict a DENV-positive diagnosis and ii) perform a molecular characterization of DENVs from the 2014 Guangdong epidemic. This retrospective study analyzed 1,044 patients from the Guangdong epidemic who were clinically suspected cases of dengue. Viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR, and viral-specific NS1 antigen was detected using enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed for the with the DENV C-prM gene junction. Patients with dengue infection had leukopenia (2.8 × 10(9)/L), thrombocytopenia (109.0 × 10(9)/L), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (56.0 IU/L) and alanine aminotransferase (43.5 IU/L), and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT, 33.5 s) (all P ＜ 0.001) compared to patients without dengue. The positive predictive value of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia for DENV infection were 96.9% and 93.0%, respectively. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated aminotransferases, and prolonged APTT were useful predictive markers for an early diagnosis of DENV infection. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the DENVs from the 2014 epidemic were closely related to a 2010 New Delhi strain and a 2013 Guangzhou strain. The 2014 epidemic consisted of co-circulating DENV-1 genotypes I and V from multiple origins. Efficient dengue surveillance can facilitate rapid response to future outbreaks. University.

In the present study, the phylogenetic relationship of six strains of the first autochthonous cases of DENV-4 infection occurred in Sao Paulo State, Parana State and Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, 2011 were studied. Nucleotide sequences of the envelope gene were determined and compared with sequences representative of the genotypes I, II, III and Sylvatic for DEN4 retrieved from GenBank.

27657335,2016 Oct 14,Dengue Protease Substrate Recognition: Binding of the Prime Side.,"Dengue virus (DENV), transmitted predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, infects millions of people and leads to dengue fever and thousands of deaths each year. There are no direct-acting antivirals to combat DENV, and molecular and structural knowledge is required to develop such compounds. The dengue NS2B/NS3 protease is a promising target for direct-acting antivirals, as viral polyprotein cleavage during replication is required for the maturation of the viral particle. The NS2B/NS3 protease processes 8 of the 13 viral polyprotein cleavage sites to allow viral maturation. Although these sites share little sequence homology beyond the P1 and P2 positions, most are well conserved among the serotypes. How the other substrate residues, especially at the P' side, affect substrate recognition remains unclear. We exploited the tight-binding general serine protease inhibitor aprotinin to investigate protease-substrate interactions at the molecular level. We engineered aprotinin's binding loop with sequences mimicking the P' side of DENV substrates. P' residues significantly modulate substrate affinity to protease, with inhibition constants varying from nanomolar to sub-millimolar. Structural and dynamic analysis revealed the molecular basis of this modulation and allowed identifying optimal residues for each of the P' positions. In addition, isothermal titration calorimetry showed binding to be solely entropy driven for all constructs. Potential flaviviral P' side inhibitors could benefit from mimicking the optimal residues at P' positions and incorporate hydrophobicity and rigidity to maintain entropic advantage for potency.

Because of the global morbidity and mortality due to Dengue, deployment of a safe and effective tetravalent vaccine has been a high priority, and to date, a partially realized goal. The study of pathogenesis and development of DENV therapeutics and vaccines has been limited by few animal models that recapitulate key features of human disease.

20836894,2010 Sep 14,Phylogenetic history demonstrates two different lineages of dengue type 1 virus in Colombia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue Fever is one of the most important viral re-emergent diseases affecting about 50 million people around the world especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In Colombia, the virus was first detected in the earliest 70's when the disease became a major public health concern. Since then, all four serotypes of the virus have been reported. Although most of the huge outbreaks reported in this country have involved dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), there are not studies about its origin, genetic diversity and distribution. RESULTS: We used 224 bp corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of envelope (E) gene from 74 Colombian isolates in order to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and to estimate time divergences. Analyzed DENV-1 Colombian isolates belonged to the formerly defined genotype V. Only one virus isolate was clasified in the genotype I, likely representing a sole introduction that did not spread. The oldest strains were closely related to those detected for the first time in America in 1977 from the Caribbean and were detected for two years until their disappearance about six years later. Around 1987, a split up generated 2 lineages that have been evolving separately, although not major amino acid changes in the analyzed region were found. CONCLUSION: DENV-1 has been circulating since 1978 in Colombia. Yet, the phylogenetic relationships between strains isolated along the covered period of time suggests that viral strains detected in some years, although belonging to the same genotype V, have different recent origins corresponding to multiple re-introduction events of viral strains that were circulating in neighbor countries. Viral strains used in the present study did not form a monophyletic group, which is evidence of a polyphyletic origin.

These proteins use a second membrane protein as a molecular chaperone to assist their folding and to ensure proper function during viral assembly, maturation, and infection.

28823471,2017 Sep 5,Epitope and Paratope Mapping Reveals Temperature-Dependent Alterations in the Dengue-Antibody Interface.,"Uncovering mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization for viral infections requires epitope and paratope mapping in the context of whole viral particle interactions with the antibody in solution. In this study, we use amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to describe the interface of a dengue virus-neutralizing antibody, 2D22, with its target epitope. 2D22 binds specifically to DENV2, a serotype showing strain-specific structural expansion at human host physiological temperatures of 37°C. Our results identify the heavy chain of 2D22 to be the primary determinant for binding DENV2. Temperature-mediated expansion alters the mode of interaction of 2D22 binding. Importantly, 2D22 interferes with the viral expansion process and offers a basis for its neutralization mechanism. The relative magnitude of deuterium exchange protection upon antibody binding across the various epitope loci allows a deconstruction of the antibody-viral interface in host-specific environments and offers a robust approach for targeted antibody engineering.

23707399,2013 Sep,Recognition of heparan sulfate by clinical strains of dengue virus serotype 1 using recombinant subviral particles.,"Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in humans, with an estimated 3.6 billion people at risk for infection and more than 200 million infections per year. Identification of the cellular receptors for dengue virus (DV), the causative agent of dengue, is important toward understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. Heparan sulfate (HS) has been characterized as a DV receptor in multiple model systems, however the physiological relevance of these findings has been questioned by observations that flaviviruses, including DV, can undergo cell culture adaptation changes resulting in increased binding to HS. It thus remains unclear whether HS is utilized by clinical, non-cell culture-adapted strains of DV. To address this question, herein we describe a set of methodologies using recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) to determine the utilization of HS by clinical strains of DV serotype 1 (DV1). RSPs of clinically isolated strains with low cell culture passage histories were used to study HS interaction. Biochemically characterized RSPs showed dose-dependent binding to immobilized heparin, which could be competed by heparin and HS but not structurally related glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulfate A and hyaluronic acid. The relevance of heparin and HS biochemical interactions was demonstrated by competition of RSP and DV binding to cells with soluble heparin and HS. Our results demonstrate that clinical strains of DV1 can specifically interact with heparin and HS. Together, these data support the possibility that HS on cell surfaces is utilized in the DV-human infection process.

24587459,2014 Feb,Limited dengue virus replication in field-collected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue is one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the world. The causative agent, dengue virus (DENV), is primarily transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a species that has proved difficult to control using conventional methods. The discovery that A. aegypti transinfected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia showed limited DENV replication led to trial field releases of these mosquitoes in Cairns, Australia as a biocontrol strategy for the virus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Field collected wMel mosquitoes that were challenged with three DENV serotypes displayed limited rates of body infection, viral replication and dissemination to the head compared to uninfected controls. Rates of dengue infection, replication and dissemination in field wMel mosquitoes were similar to those observed in the original transinfected wMel line that had been maintained in the laboratory. We found that wMel was distributed in similar body tissues in field mosquitoes as in laboratory ones, but, at seven days following blood-feeding, wMel densities increased to a greater extent in field mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that virus-blocking is likely to persist in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes after their release and establishment in wild populations, suggesting that Wolbachia biocontrol may be a successful strategy for reducing dengue transmission in the field.

9892712,1999 Jan 19,The effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics and persistence of multiple-strain pathogens.,"Cross-reactive antibodies produced by a mammalian host during infection by a particular microparasitic strain usually have the effect of reducing the probability of the host being infected by a different, but closely related, pathogen strain. Such cross-reactive immunological responses thereby induce between-strain competition within the pathogen population. However, in some cases such as dengue virus, evidence suggests that cross-reactive antibodies act to enhance rather than restrict the severity of a subsequent infection by another strain. This cooperative mechanism is thought to explain why pre-existing immunity to dengue virus is an important risk factor for the development of severe disease (i.e., dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). In this paper, we explore the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics of multistrain pathogen populations. We show that enhancement frequently may generate complex and persistent cyclical or chaotic epidemic behavior. Furthermore, enhancement acts to permit the coexistence of all strains where in its absence only one or a subset would persist. of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom.","['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions/*immunology', 'Dengue/epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data', 'Mammals/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Serology']","['Cross-reactive antibodies produced by a mammalian host during infection by a particular microparasitic strain usually have the effect of reducing the probability of the host being infected by a different, but closely related, pathogen strain.', 'Such cross-reactive immunological responses thereby induce between-strain competition within the pathogen population.', 'However, in some cases such as dengue virus, evidence suggests that cross-reactive antibodies act to enhance rather than restrict the severity of a subsequent infection by another strain.', 'This cooperative mechanism is thought to explain why pre-existing immunity to dengue virus is an important risk factor for the development of severe disease (i.e., dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever).', 'In this paper, we explore the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics of multistrain pathogen populations.', 'We show that enhancement frequently may generate complex and persistent cyclical or chaotic epidemic behavior.', 'Furthermore, enhancement acts to permit the coexistence of all strains where in its absence only one or a subset would persist.', 'of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom.']"
20539043,2010 Jun,"Patient-based dengue virus surveillance in Aedes aegypti from Recife, Brazil.","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Dengue is currently one of the most important arthropod-borne diseases and may be caused by four different dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes. With the lack of a dengue vaccine, vector control strategies constitute a crucial mode to prevent or reduce disease transmission. In this context, DENV detection in natural Ae. aegypti populations may serve as a potential additional tool for early prediction systems of dengue outbreaks, leading to an intensification of vector control measures, aimed at reducing disease transmission. In Brazil, this type of surveillance has been performed sporadically by a few groups and has not been incorporated as a routine activity in control programs. This study aimed at detecting DENV in natural Ae. aegypti from Recife, Pernambuco, to check the circulating serotypes and the occurrence of transovarial transmission in local mosquito populations. METHODS: From January 2005 to June 2006, mosquitoes (adults and eggs) were collected in houses where people with clinical suspicion of dengue infection lived at. RNA was extracted from pooled mosquitoes and RT-PCR was performed in these samples for detection of the four DENV serotypes. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Out of 83 pools of adult mosquitoes collected in the field, nine were positive for DENV: five for DENV-1, two for DENV-2 and two for DENV-3. From 139 pools of adult mosquitoes reared from collected eggs, there were 17 positive pools: three for DENV-1, 10 for DENV-2, and four for DENV-3. These results are discussed in the paper in regard to the local dengue epidemiological data. The conclusions clearly point to the informative power and sensitivity of DENV entomological surveillance and to the importance of including mosquito immature forms in this strategy.

30622191,2019 Jan 8,RNA Structure Duplication in the Dengue Virus 3' UTR: Redundancy or Host Specificity?,"Flaviviruses include a diverse group of medically important viruses that cycle between mosquitoes and humans. During this natural process of switching hosts, each species imposes different selective forces on the viral population. Using dengue virus (DENV) as model, we found that paralogous RNA structures originating from duplications in the viral 3' untranslated region (UTR) are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. These RNA structures, known as dumbbells (DB1 and DB2), were originally proposed to be enhancers of viral replication. Analysis of viruses obtained from infected mosquitoes showed selection of mutations that mapped in DB2. Recombinant viruses carrying the identified variations confirmed that these mutations greatly increase viral replication in mosquito cells, with low or no impact in human cells. Use of viruses lacking each of the DB structures revealed opposite viral phenotypes. While deletion of DB1 reduced viral replication about 10-fold, viruses lacking DB2 displayed a great increase of fitness in mosquitoes, confirming a functional diversification of these similar RNA elements. Mechanistic analysis indicated that DB1 and DB2 differentially modulate viral genome cyclization and RNA replication. We found that a pseudoknot formed within DB2 competes with long-range RNA-RNA interactions that are necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis. Our results support a model in which a functional diversification of duplicated RNA elements in the viral 3' UTR is driven by host-specific requirements. This study provides new ideas for understanding molecular aspects of the evolution of RNA viruses that naturally jump between different species.IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses constitute the most relevant group of arthropod-transmitted viruses, including important human pathogens such as the dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The natural alternation of these viruses between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts shapes the viral genome population, which leads to selection of different viral variants with potential implications for epidemiological fitness and pathogenesis. However, the selective forces and mechanisms acting on the viral RNA during host adaptation are still largely unknown. Here, we found that two almost identical tandem RNA structures present at the viral 3' untranslated region are under different selective pressures in the two hosts. Mechanistic studies indicated that the two RNA elements, known as dumbbells, contain sequences that overlap essential RNA cyclization elements involved in viral RNA synthesis. The data support a model in which the duplicated RNA structures differentially evolved to accommodate distinct functions for viral replication in the two hosts. Pasteur, Paris, France.

16597854,2006 Apr,Development of real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays to detect and serotype dengue viruses.,"Serotyping dengue virus (DENV) from suspect human specimens is crucial for developing sound epidemiological control measurements early in the transmission season and for effective patient management. We modified DENV consensus D1 (mD1) and serotype-specific TS2 (mTS2) and redesigned serotype-specific TS1 (rTS1) and TS4 (rTS4) as described previously in the conventional capsid and premembrane gene (C-prM) protocol (R. S. Lanciotti, C. H. Calisher, D. J. Gubler, G.-J. Chang, A. V. Vorndam, J. Clin. Microbiol. 30:545-551, 1992). In addition, we designed two new sets of amplimers and probes, located at nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) and the 3' noncoding region (3'NC) of DENV. The NS5 protocol utilizes two flaviviral consensus outer amplimers (mFU1 and CFD2) and four dengue virus serotype-specific TaqMan fluorogenic probes. The 3'NC protocol uses two DENV consensus amplimers, DC10418 and CDC10564. The conventional gel-based, heminested detection method was adapted for the C-prM protocol for detecting and serotyping dengue viruses. In addition, we developed the real-time SYBR green I and postamplification melting temperature curve analysis for the mD1/TS and 3'NC protocols using identical amplification conditions. The NS5 amplimer/probe set was formulated as a one-tube, multiplex, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for serotype identification. Three sets of amplimers and probes were verified for their specificity in tests with yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and West Nile viruses; optimized against 109 DENV strains; and validated for detection of the virus in sera from two different panels of acute-phase human dengue serum specimens and one panel of virus isolates from dengue patients' serum specimens. Clinical evaluation by two separate laboratories indicated that the C-prM was more sensitive (100%) than the NS5 (91%) or the 3'NC (91%) protocol.

29998087,2018,"Molecular Characterization of Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Cosmospolitan Genotype From 2015 Dengue Outbreak in Yunnan, China.","In 2015, a dengue outbreak with 1,067 reported cases occurred in Xishuangbanna, a city in China that borders Burma and Laos. To characterize the virus, the complete genome sequence was obtained and phylogenetic, mutation, substitution and recombinant analyses were performed. DENV-NS1 positive serum samples were collected from dengue fever patients, and complete genome sequences were obtained through RT-qPCR from these serum samples. Phylogenetic trees were then constructed by maximum likelihood phylogeny test (MEGA7.0), followed by analysis of nucleotide mutation and amino acid substitution. The recombination events among DENVs were also analyzed by RDP4 package. The diversity analysis of secondary structure for translated viral proteins was also performed. The complete genome sequences of four amplified viruses (YNXJ10, YNXJ12, YNXJ13, and YNXJ16) were 10,742, 10,742, 10,741, and 10,734 nucleotides in length, and phylogenetic analysis classified the viruses as cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2. All viruses were close to DENV Singapore 2013 (KX380828.1) and the DENV China 2013 (KF479233.1). In comparison to DENV-2SS (M29095), the total numbers of base substitutions were 712 nt (YNXJ10), 809 nt (YNXJ12), 772 nt (YNXJ13), and 841 nt (YNXJ16), resulting in 109, 171, 130, and 180 amino acid substitutions in translated regions, respectively. In addition, compared with KX380828.1, there were 44, 105, 64, and 116 amino acid substitutions in translated regions, respectively. The highest mutation rate occurred in the prM region, and the lowest mutation rate occurred in the NS4B region. Most of the recombination events occurred in the prM, E and NS2B/3 regions, which corresponded with the mutation frequency of the related portion. Secondary structure prediction within the 3,391 amino acids of DENV structural proteins showed there were 7 new possible nucleotide-binding sites and 6 lost sites compared to DENV-2SS. In addition, 41 distinct amino acid changes were found in the helix regions, although the distribution of the exposed and buried regions changed only slightly. Our findings may help to understand the intrinsic geographical relatedness of DENV-2 and contributes to the understanding of viral evolution and its impact on the epidemic potential and pathogenicity of DENV.

34429064,2021 Aug 24,Multifoci and multiserotypes circulation of dengue virus in Senegal between 2017 and 2018.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito born disease associated with self-limited to life threatening illness. First detected in Senegal in the nineteenth century, and despite its growing incidence this last decade, significant knowledge gaps exist in our knowledge of genetic diversity of circulating strains. This study highlights the circulating serotypes and genotypes between January 2017 and December 2018 and their spatial and temporal distribution throughout all regions of Senegal. METHODS: We used 56 dengue virus (DENV) strains for the analysis collected from 11 sampling areas: 39 from all regions of Senegal, and 17 isolates from Thiès, a particular area of the country. Two real time RT-qPCR systems were used to confirm dengue infection and corresponding serotypes. For molecular characterization, CprM gene was sequenced and submitted to phylogenetic analysis for serotypes and genotypes assignment. RESULTS: Three dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-3) were detected by all used methods. DENV-3 was detected in 50% (28/56) of the isolates, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-2, each representing 25% (14/56) of the isolates. DENV-3 belongs to genotype III, DENV-1 to genotype V and DENV-2 to Cosmopolitan genotype. Serotype 3 was detected in 7 sampling locations and a co-circulation of different serotypes was observed in Thiès, Fatick and Richard-toll. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the need of continuous DENV surveillance in Senegal to detect DENV cases, to define circulating serotypes/genotypes and to prevent the spread and the occurrence of severe cases.

23485430,2013 Jul,"Molecular characterization of the envelope gene of dengue virus type 3 newly isolated in Guangzhou, China, during 2009-2010.","BACKGROUND: After an absence of 29 years, dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) re-emerged in Guangzhou in 2009 and again in 2010. However, the geographical route by which the virus entered the city, and how it has changed genetically, remain unclear. Therefore, we carried out a comprehensive investigation into the molecular characteristics of the DENV-3 involved. METHODS: The envelope (E) genes of viruses isolated from dengue patients during the 2009-2010 epidemics were sequenced and compared with previously published E gene sequences of global representative DENV-3 strains available in GenBank, including isolates circulating in other provinces of China. RESULTS: A total of 13 isolates (seven from 2009 and six from 2010) were obtained from human serum samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates were grouped into three genotypes (I, III, and V) and then two clades within genotype III (genotype I from Indonesia, genotype III clade A from Côte d'Ivoire, genotype III clade B from Tanzania, and genotype V from Philippines). In addition, there were 1.3-9.0% and 0.5-3.9% differences in the nucleic and deduced amino acid sequences between the 2009 and 2010 strains, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The DENV-3 viruses from the period 2009-2010 were not from the continuous spread of an epidemic strain or the re-emergence of the 2009 strains in the 2-year period.

29973622,2018 Jul 4,Direct evidence of a low barrier hydrogen bond in the catalytic triad of a Serine protease.,"Serine proteases are one of the largest groups of enzymes, found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and are responsible for many different functions. The detailed information about the hydrogen-bonds in the catalytic triad (Asp…His…Ser) of these enzymes is of importance in order to fully understand the mechanism of action. The aspartate of the triad is hydrogen bonded to the histidine but the exact nature of this bond has been under discussion for some time. It is either a common short ionic hydrogen bond (SIHB) or a delocalized low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) were the hydrogen bond is shorter. So far, the evidence for LBHB in proteins have not been conclusive. Here we show clear NMR evidence that LBHB does exist in NS3, a serine protease from Dengue. The one bond coupling constant between the hydrogen and nitrogen was shown to be only 52 Hz instead of the usual 90 Hz. This together with a (1)H chemical shift of 19.93 ppm is evidence that the hydrogen bond distance between His and Asp is shorter than for SIHB. Our result clearly shows the existence of LBHB and will help in understanding the mechanism of the catalytic triad in the important group of serine proteases.

15933777,2005 Jun,Molecular epidemiology of type 1 and 2 dengue viruses in Brazil from 1988 to 2001.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that in recent decades has become a major international public health concern. Epidemic dengue fever reemerged in Brazil in 1981. Since 1990 more than one dengue virus serotype has been circulating in this tropical country and increasing rates of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome have been detected every year. Some evidence supports the association between the introduction of a new serotype and/or genotype in a region and the appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever. In order to study the evolutionary relationships and possible detection of the introduction of new dengue virus genotypes in Brazil in the last years, we analyzed partial nucleotide sequences of 52 Brazilian samples of both dengue type 1 and dengue type 2 isolated from 1988 to 2001 from highly endemic regions. A 240-nucleotide-long sequence from the envelope/nonstructural protein 1 gene junction was used for phylogenetic analysis. After comparing the nucleotide sequences originally obtained in this study to those previously studied by others, and analyzing the phylogenetic trees, we conclude that, after the initial introduction of the currently circulating dengue-1 and dengue-2 genotypes in Brazil, there has been no evidence of introduction of new genotypes since 1988. The increasing number of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases seen in Brazil in the last years is probably associated with secondary infections or with the introduction of new serotypes but not with the introduction of new genotypes.

33291644,2020 Dec 4,Peptide-Conjugated Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers for In Situ Live-Cell Molecular Imaging of Dengue Virus Replication.,"Current methods to detect and monitor pathogens in biological systems are largely limited by the tradeoffs between spatial context and temporal detail. A new generation of molecular tracking that provides both information simultaneously involves in situ detection coupled with non-invasive imaging. An example is antisense imaging that uses antisense oligonucleotide probes complementary to a target nucleotide sequence. In this study, we explored the potential of repurposing antisense oligonucleotides initially developed as antiviral therapeutics as molecular probes for imaging of viral infections in vitro and in vivo. We employed nuclease-resistant phosphorodiamidate synthetic oligonucleotides conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides (i.e., PPMOs) previously established as antivirals for dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV2). As proof of concept, and before further development for preclinical testing, we evaluated its validity as in situ molecular imaging probe for tracking cellular DENV2 infection using live-cell fluorescence imaging. Although the PPMO was designed to specifically target the DENV2 genome, it was unsuitable as in situ molecular imaging probe. This study details our evaluation of the PPMOs to assess specific and sensitive molecular imaging of DENV2 infection and tells a cautionary tale for those exploring antisense oligonucleotides as probes for non-invasive imaging and monitoring of pathogen infections in experimental animal models.

The genotypic diversity of Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes involved in dengue outbreaks since 2005 in Pakistan is not well studied. Here, we investigated the origin, diversity, genetic relationships and geographic distribution of DENV to understand virus evolution during the recent expansion of dengue in Pakistan. METHODS: The study included 200 sera obtained from dengue-suspected patients from 2006 to 2011. DENV infection was confirmed in 94 (47%) sera by a polymerase chain reaction assay. These included 36 (38.3%) DENV-2, 57 DENV-3 (60.6%) and 1 DENV-4 (1.1%) cases. Sequences of 13 whole genomes (6 DENV-2, 6 DENV-3 and 1 DENV-4) and 49 envelope genes (26 DENV-2, 22 DENV-3 and 1 DENV-4) were analysed to determine the origin, phylogeny, diversity and selection pressure during virus evolution. RESULTS: DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 in Pakistan from 2006 to 2011 shared 98.5-99.6% nucleotide and 99.3-99.9% amino acid similarity with those circulated in the Indian subcontinent during the last decade. Nevertheless, Pakistan DENV-2 and DENV-3 strains formed distinct clades characterized by amino acid signatures of NS2A-I116T + NS5-K861R and NS3-K590R + NS5-S895L respectively. Each clade consisted of a heterogenous virus population that circulated in Southern (2006-2009) and Northern Pakistan (2011). CONCLUSIONS: DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 that circulated during 2006-2011 are likely to have first introduced via the southern route of Pakistan. Both DENV-2 and DENV-3 have undergone in-situ evolution to generate heterogenous populations, possibly driven by sustained local DENV transmission during 2006-2011 periods. While both DENV-2 and DENV-3 continued to circulate in Southern Pakistan until 2009, DENV-2 has spread in a Northern direction to establish in Punjab Province, which experienced a massive dengue outbreak in 2011. as a] WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research of Arbovirus and their Associated Vectors, 11, Biopolis Way, #06-05-08, 138667 Singapore, Singapore. david_lee@nea.gov.sg.","['Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Phylogeography', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology']","['BACKGROUND: Even though dengue has been recognized as one of the major public health threats in Pakistan, the understanding of its molecular epidemiology is still limited.', 'The genotypic diversity of Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes involved in dengue outbreaks since 2005 in Pakistan is not well studied.', 'Here, we investigated the origin, diversity, genetic relationships and geographic distribution of DENV to understand virus evolution during the recent expansion of dengue in Pakistan.', 'METHODS: The study included 200 sera obtained from dengue-suspected patients from 2006 to 2011.', 'DENV infection was confirmed in 94 (47%) sera by a polymerase chain reaction assay.', 'These included 36 (38.3%) DENV-2, 57 DENV-3 (60.6%) and 1 DENV-4 (1.1%) cases.', 'Sequences of 13 whole genomes (6 DENV-2, 6 DENV-3 and 1 DENV-4) and 49 envelope genes (26 DENV-2, 22 DENV-3 and 1 DENV-4) were analysed to determine the origin, phylogeny, diversity and selection pressure during virus evolution.', 'RESULTS: DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 in Pakistan from 2006 to 2011 shared 98.5-99.6% nucleotide and 99.3-99.9% amino acid similarity with those circulated in the Indian subcontinent during the last decade.', 'Nevertheless, Pakistan DENV-2 and DENV-3 strains formed distinct clades characterized by amino acid signatures of NS2A-I116T + NS5-K861R and NS3-K590R + NS5-S895L respectively.', 'Each clade consisted of a heterogenous virus population that circulated in Southern (2006-2009) and Northern Pakistan (2011).', 'CONCLUSIONS: DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 that circulated during 2006-2011 are likely to have first introduced via the southern route of Pakistan.', 'Both DENV-2 and DENV-3 have undergone in-situ evolution to generate heterogenous populations, possibly driven by sustained local DENV transmission during 2006-2011 periods.', 'While both DENV-2 and DENV-3 continued to circulate in Southern Pakistan until 2009, DENV-2 has spread in a Northern direction to establish in Punjab Province, which experienced a massive dengue outbreak in 2011.', 'as a] WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research of Arbovirus and their Associated Vectors, 11, Biopolis Way, #06-05-08, 138667 Singapore, Singapore.', 'david_lee@nea.gov.sg', '.']"

In 2017, an unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in Zhejiang, China. To clarify and characterize the causative agent of this outbreak, data on dengue fever cases were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Zhejiang province for subsequent epidemiological analysis. A total of 1,229 cases were reported, including 1,149 indigenous and 80 imported cases. Most indigenous cases (1,128 cases) were in Hangzhou. The epidemic peak occurred in late August and early September, and the incidence rate of elderly people (4.34 per 100,000) was relatively high. Imported cases were reported all year round, and most were from South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions. Young people and men accounted for a large fraction of the cases. Acute phase serums of patients were collected for virus isolation. And 35 isolates (including 25 DV-2, 8 DV-1, 1 DV-3, and 1 DV-4) were obtained after inoculation and culture in mosquito C6/36 cells. The E genes of the 35 new DV isolates and the complete genome of a DV-2 isolate (Zhejiang/HZ33/2017), and the E gene of a DV-2 isolate from Ae. albopictus (Zhejiang/Aedes-1/2017) were determined. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method with the Tajima-Nei model. Phylogenetically, DVs of all four serotypes with multiple genotypes (mainly including 21 Cosmopolitan genotype DV-2, 4 Asian I genotype DV-2, 6 genotype I DV-1, and 2 genotype V DV-1) were present in the indigenous and imported cases in Zhejiang during the same period. Most of the isolates probably originated from South-East Asia and Western Pacific countries.

24637211,2014 Apr 4,Antibody germline characterization of cross-neutralizing human IgGs against 4 serotypes of dengue virus.,"Dengue virus (DENV), a re-emerging virus, constitutes the largest vector-borne disease virus, with 50-100 million cases reported every year. Although DENV infection induces lifelong immunity against viruses of the same serotypes, the subsequent infection with the heterologous serotypes can cause more severe form of the disease, such as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). However, there is neither approved vaccine nor specific drugs available to treat this disease. In this study, previously developed 19 human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) showing strong to moderate cross neutralizing activity were selected. Most of them (13/19) were targeted to domain II of envelop glycoprotein. To understand and clarify the recognition properties, the maturation mechanisms comprising Variable/Diversity/Joining (VDJ) recombination, Variable Heavy (VH)/Variable Light (VL) chain pairing, variability at junctional site, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of those antibodies were studied and compared with their predecessor germline sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST database was applied to analyze the isolated VH and VL sequences. To confirm the correction of isolated VH/VL, 3 HuMAbs (1A10H7, 1B3B9, 1G7C2) was transiently expressed in HEK293T cell.

24073945,2013 Sep 28,Dengue virus type 1 clade replacement in recurring homotypic outbreaks.,"BACKGROUND: Recurring dengue outbreaks occur in cyclical pattern in most endemic countries. The recurrences of dengue virus (DENV) infection predispose the population to increased risk of contracting the severe forms of dengue. Understanding the DENV evolutionary mechanism underlying the recurring dengue outbreaks has important implications for epidemic prediction and disease control. RESULTS: We used a set of viral envelope (E) gene to reconstruct the phylogeny of DENV-1 isolated between the periods of 1987-2011 in Malaysia. Phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 E gene revealed that genotype I virus clade replacements were associated with the cyclical pattern of major DENV-1 outbreaks in Malaysia. A total of 9 non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the DENV-1 E gene consensus were identified; 4 in domain I, 3 in domain II and 2 in domain III. Selection pressure analyses did not reveal any positively selected codon site within the full length E gene sequences (1485 nt, 495 codons). A total of 183 (mean dN/dS = 0.0413) negatively selected sites were found within the Malaysian isolates; neither positive nor negative selection was noted for the remaining 312 codons. All the viruses were cross-neutralized by the respective patient sera suggesting no strong support for immunological advantage of any of the amino acid substitutions. CONCLUSION: DENV-1 clade replacement is associated with recurrences of major DENV-1 outbreaks in Malaysia. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies that the DENV-1 clade replacement is a stochastic event independent of positive selection. of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia. sazaly@um.edu.my.","['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/genetics/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Disease Outbreaks', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Stochastic Processes']","['BACKGROUND: Recurring dengue outbreaks occur in cyclical pattern in most endemic countries.', 'The recurrences of dengue virus (DENV) infection predispose the population to increased risk of contracting the severe forms of dengue.', 'Understanding the DENV evolutionary mechanism underlying the recurring dengue outbreaks has important implications for epidemic prediction and disease control.', 'RESULTS: We used a set of viral envelope (E) gene to reconstruct the phylogeny of DENV-1 isolated between the periods of 1987-2011 in Malaysia.', 'Phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 E gene revealed that genotype I virus clade replacements were associated with the cyclical pattern of major DENV-1 outbreaks in Malaysia.', 'A total of 9 non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the DENV-1 E gene consensus were identified; 4 in domain I, 3 in domain II and 2 in domain III.', 'Selection pressure analyses did not reveal any positively selected codon site within the full length E gene sequences (1485 nt, 495 codons).', 'A total of 183 (mean dN/dS = 0.0413) negatively selected sites were found within the Malaysian isolates; neither positive nor negative selection was noted for the remaining 312 codons.', 'All the viruses were cross-neutralized by the respective patient sera suggesting no strong support for immunological advantage of any of the amino acid substitutions.', 'CONCLUSION: DENV-1 clade replacement is associated with recurrences of major DENV-1 outbreaks in Malaysia.', 'Our findings are consistent with those of other studies that the DENV-1 clade replacement is a stochastic event independent of positive selection.', 'of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.', 'sazaly@um.edu.my', '.']"
31461934,2019 Aug 27,"A Dengue Virus Type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B-Interacting Host Factor, SERP1, Reduces DENV-2 Production by Suppressing Viral RNA Replication.","Host cells infected with dengue virus (DENV) often trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key process that allows viral reproduction, without killing the host cells until the late stage of the virus life-cycle. However, little is known regarding which DENV viral proteins interact with the ER machinery to support viral replication. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel host factor, stress-associated ER protein 1 (SERP1), which interacts with the DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B protein by several assays, for example, yeast two-hybrid, subcellular localization, NanoBiT complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. A drastic increase (34.5-fold) in the SERP1 gene expression was observed in the DENV-2-infected or replicon-transfected Huh7.5 cells. The SERP1 overexpression inhibited viral yields (37-fold) in the DENV-2-infected Huh7.5 cells. In contrast, shRNAi-knockdown and the knockout of SERP1 increased the viral yields (3.4- and 16-fold, respectively) in DENV-2-infected HEK-293 and Huh7.5 cells, respectively. DENV-2 viral RNA replication was severely reduced in stable SERP1-expressing Huh7.5 cells transfected with DENV-2 replicon plasmids. The overexpression of DENV-2 NS4B alleviated the inhibitory effect of SERP1 on DENV-2 RNA replication. Taking these results together, we hypothesized that SERP1 may serve as an antiviral player during ER stress to restrict DENV-2 infection. Our studies revealed novel anti-DENV drug targets that may facilitate anti-DENV drug discovery. Institutes, Miaoli 35053, Taiwan. Institutes, Miaoli 35053, Taiwan. 35053, Taiwan. 11221, Taiwan.

However, very limited information was available to date regarding the genetic characterization and epidemiology of Bolivian dengue virus strains. Here, we performed genetic characterization of the full-length envelope gene of 64 Bolivian isolates from 1998 to 2008 and investigated their origin and evolution to determine whether strains circulated simultaneously or alternatively, and whether or not multiple introductions of distinct viral variants had occurred during the period studied. We determined that, during the last decade, closely related viruses circulated during several consecutive years (5, 6, and 6 years for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, respectively) and the co-circulation of two or even three serotypes was observed. Emergence of new variants (distinct from those identified during the previous episodes) was identified in the case of DENV-1 (2007 outbreak) and DENV-2 (2001 outbreak).

However, it has not been known to have caused a local outbreak in China for the past 20 years. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the epidemiology of one local community outbreak caused by DENV-4 in Guangzhou city, China, in 2010; and to determine the molecular characteristics of the genotype II virus involved. CASE PRESENTATIONS: During September and October of 2010, one imported case, a Guangzhou resident who travelled back from Thailand, resulted in 18 secondary autochthonous cases in Guangzhou City, with an incidence rate of 5.53 per 10,000 residents. In indigenous cases, 14 serum samples tested positive for IgM against DENV and 7 for IgG from a total of 15 submitted serum samples, accompanied by 5 DENV-4 isolates. With identical envelope gene nucleotide sequences, the two isolates (D10168-GZ from the imported index case and Guangzhou 10660 from the first isolate in the autochthonous cases) were grouped into DENV-4 genotype II after comparison to 32 previous DENV-4 isolates from GenBank that originated from different areas.

31730672,2019 Nov,Sylvatic dengue virus type 4 in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in an urban setting in Peninsular Malaysia.,"Dengue fever is endemic in Malaysia, contributing to significant economic and health burden in the country. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the main vectors of the dengue virus (DENV), which circulates in sylvatic and human transmission cycles and has been present in Malaysia for decades. The study investigated the presence and distribution of DENV in urban localities in the Klang Valley, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 364 Ae. aegypti and 1,025 Ae. albopictus larvae, and 10 Ae. aegypti and 42 Ae. albopictus adult mosquitoes were screened for the presence of DENV. In total, 31 (2.2%) samples were positive, of which 2 Ae. albopictus larvae were co-infected with two serotypes, one with DENV-2 and DENV-3 and the other with DENV-3 and DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the isolates belonged to DENV-1 genotype I (1 Ae. aegypti adult), DENV-2 (1 Ae. albopictus larva), DENV-3 genotype V (3 Ae. aegypti larvae and 10 Ae. albopictus larvae) and DENV-4 genotype IV (6 Ae. aegypti larvae and 12 Ae. albopictus larvae), a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 which was most closely related with sylvatic strains isolated from arboreal mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys in Peninsular Malaysia in the 1970s. All four DENV serotypes were co-circulating throughout the study period. The detection of a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia highlights the susceptibility of these vectors to infection with sylvatic DENV.

23093838,2012,Protegrin-1 inhibits dengue NS2B-NS3 serine protease and viral replication in MK2 cells.,"Dengue diseases have an economic as well as social burden worldwide. In this study, the antiviral activity of protegrin-1 (PG-1, RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR) peptide towards dengue NS2B-NS3pro and viral replication in Rhesus monkey kidney (MK2) cells was investigated. The peptide PG-1 was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, and disulphide bonds formation followed by peptide purification was confirmed by LC-MS and RPHPLC. Dengue NS2B-NS3pro was produced as a single-chain recombinant protein in E. coli. The NS2B-NS3pro assay was carried out by measuring the florescence emission of catalyzed substrate. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the inhibition potential of PG-1 towards dengue serotype-2 (DENV-2) replication in MK2 cells. The results showed that PG-1 inhibited dengue NS2B-NS3pro at IC(50) of 11.7 μM. The graded concentrations of PG-1 at nontoxic range were able to reduce viral replication significantly (P < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 hrs after viral infection.

38664380,2024 Apr 25,Travel surveillance uncovers dengue virus dynamics and introductions in the Caribbean.,"Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and cases are continuing to rise globally. In particular, islands in the Caribbean have experienced more frequent outbreaks, and all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been reported in the region, leading to hyperendemicity and increased rates of severe disease. However, there is significant variability regarding virus surveillance and reporting between islands, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the epidemiological patterns in the Caribbean. To investigate this, we used travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology to reconstruct outbreak dynamics, DENV serotype turnover, and patterns of spread within the region from 2009-2022. We uncovered two recent DENV-3 introductions from Asia, one of which resulted in a large outbreak in Cuba, which was previously under-reported. We also show that while outbreaks can be synchronized between islands, they are often caused by different serotypes. Our study highlights the importance of surveillance of infected travelers to provide a snapshot of local introductions and transmission in areas with limited local surveillance and suggests that the recent DENV-3 introductions may pose a major public health threat in the region. emma.taylor-salmon@yale.edu.

19053243,2008 Dec 19,Antiviral compounds discovered by virtual screening of small-molecule libraries against dengue virus E protein.,"Infection by the mosquito-borne dengue virus causes dengue fever and the sometimes fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever. The increasing number of dengue infections per year suggests that the virus is becoming more virulent and its transmission is expanding. Nevertheless, no effective treatment for dengue infection currently exists. In a search for antiviral agents effective against dengue virus, we investigated the potential of targeting a structural protein site rather than an enzymatic one. Using this approach, we now report the discovery of a small molecule ligand that inhibits viral growth. Our results also provide the first evidence that the binding site, a pocket located at the hinge between domains 1 and 2 of the envelope protein (E protein) on the virus surface, is a valid target for antiviral therapy. Ligand candidates were identified from libraries of approximately 142,000 compounds using a computational high-throughput screening protocol targeting this pocket of the E protein. Cell-based assays were conducted on 23 top-ranked compounds. Among four with good antiviral activity profiles, the compound P02 was found to inhibit viral reproduction at micromolar concentrations. Using saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy, we also show that the compound binds virus and competes for binding E protein with the known ligand N-octyl-beta-D-glucoside. Together, the results are consistent with an inhibition mechanism against maturation or host-cell entry mediated by ligand binding to the E-protein pocket. P02 is a promising lead compound for future development of an effective treatment against dengue virus and related flaviviruses.

30685587,2019 Jul,Incidence of dengue illness among children in an urban setting in South India: A population based study.,"OBJECTIVES: Our main objective was to estimate population based dengue incidence estimates in children with fever >3 days. METHODS: The study used the 'National Surveillance System for Enteric Fever in India' (NSSEFI) cohort at the Vellore site. Children aged 6 months to 14 years from a peri-urban setting in Vellore were followed up for a year for the presence of fever. All children who had fever >3days were eligible for blood culture to diagnose typhoid. All children that presented with fever >3days on alternate days of the week were also tested for dengue. Dengue incidence estimates were then calculated. RESULTS: There were 6648 children followed up with a cumulative observation period of 5800 child years. There were 11753 fever episodes with 3171 (27%) episodes lasting >3 days. Totally, 784 children with 868 episodes of fever were tested for Dengue. NS1 antigen or Dengue IgM or both were positive in 82 (9.4%) of those tested for Dengue. Dengue PCR was positive in 33/64 (51.6%) of the samples positive samples. The annual incidence rate of dengue was 49.5 per 1000 child years among children with fever >3 days. CONCLUSIONS: There is high burden of dengue in peri-urban Vellore. 632004, India.

33958631,2021 May 6,Comparative analysis of liver involvement caused by two DENV-2 lineages using an immunocompetent murine model.,"Dengue (DEN) is the most prevalent arbovirus among humans, and four billion people live at risk of infection. The clinical manifestations of DEN are variable, and the disease may present subclinically or asymptomatically. A quarter of patients develop classical dengue (CD) or severe dengue (SD), which is potentially lethal and involves vascular permeability changes, severe hemorrhage and organ damage. The involvement of the liver is a fairly common feature in DEN, and alterations range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to acute liver failure. Since its introduction in Brazil in 1990, two strains of Dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) have been detected: Lineage I, which is responsible for an outbreak in 1991, and Lineage II, which caused an epidemic greater than the previous one and had a different epidemiological profile. To date, studies on different strains of the same serotype/genotype and their association with disease severity are scarce. In addition, one of the greatest challenges regarding the study of DEN pathogenesis and the development of drug and vaccine therapies is the absence of an animal model that reproduces the disease as it occurs in humans. The main goals of this study were to assess BALB/c mouse susceptibility experimentally infected by two distinct DENV-2 strains and characterize possible differences in the clinical signs and alterations induced in the liver resulting from those infections. Mice infected by the two DENV-2 lineages gained less weight than uninfected mice; however, their livers were slightly heavier. Increased AST and AST levels were observed in infected mice, and the number of platelets increased in the first 72 h of infection and subsequently decreased. Mice infected with both lineages presented leukocytosis but at different times of infection. The histopathological changes induced by both lineages were similar and comparable to the changes observed in DEN fatal cases. The viral genome was detected in two liver samples. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to both DENV-2 lineages and suggest that the changes induced by those strains are similar, although for some parameters, they are manifested at different times of infection.

24916872,2014 Jun 11,"Molecular surveillance of Dengue in Sukabumi, West Java province, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: Dengue is endemic and affects people in all Indonesian provinces. Increasing dengue cases have been observed every year in Sukabumi in West Java province. Despite the endemicity, limited data is available on the genetic of dengue viruses (DENV) circulating in the country. To understand the dynamics of dengue disease, we performed molecular and serological surveillance of dengue in Sukabumi. METHODOLOGY: A total of 113 patients were recruited for this study. Serological data were obtained using anti-dengue IgM and IgG tests plus dengue NS1 antigen detection. Dengue detection and serotyping were performed using real-time RT-PCR. Viruses were isolated and the envelope genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses were performed to determine the genotype of the viruses and their evolutionary rates. RESULTS: Real-time RT-PCR detected DENV in 25 (22%) of 113 samples. Serotyping revealed the predominance of DENV-2 (16 isolates, 64%), followed by DENV-1 (5 isolates, 20%), and DENV-4 (4 isolates, 16%). No DENV-3 was detected in the samples. Co-circulation of genotype I and IV of DENV-1 was observed. The DENV-2 isolates all belonged to the Cosmopolitan genotype, while DENV-4 isolates were grouped into genotype II. Overall, their evolutionary rates were similar to DENV from other countries. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed the distribution of DENV serotypes and genotypes in Sukabumi. Compared to data obtained from other cities in Indonesia, we observed the differing predominance of DENV serotypes but similar genotype distribution, where the infecting viruses were closely related with Indonesian endemic viruses isolated previously.

15721358,2005 Mar 15,Secretion of noninfectious dengue virus-like particles and identification of amino acids in the stem region involved in intracellular retention of envelope protein.,"DNA plasmids that express flavivirus premembrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) proteins in the form of virus-like particles (VLPs) have an excellent potential as DNA vaccine candidates against virus infection. The plasmid-expressed VLPs are also useful as safe, noninfectious antigens in serodiagnostic assays. We have constructed plasmids containing the prM/M and E gene regions for DENV-1, -3, and -4 that express and secrete VLPs when electroporated into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Constructs containing the full-length DENV-1 E protein gene did not secrete VLPs into tissue culture fluid effectively. However, a 16-fold increase in ELISA titers of DENV-1 VLPs was achieved after replacing the carboxy-terminal 20% region of DENV-1 E protein gene with the corresponding sequence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). DENV-3 plasmids containing either the full-length DENV-3 E protein gene or the 20% JEV sequence replacement secreted VLPs to similarly high levels. Whereas DENV-4 VLPs were secreted to high levels by plasmids containing the full-length DENV-4 E protein gene but not by the chimeric plasmid containing 20% JEV E replacement. Domain substitutions by replacing prM/M protein stem-anchor region with the corresponding prM/M stem-anchor region of JEV or DENV-2 in the chimeric DENV-4 construct failed to promote the secretion of DENV-4 VLPs. Using the DENV-2 chimeric plasmid with carboxy-terminal 10% of JEV E gene, the sequence responsible for intracellular localization of E protein was mapped onto the E-H1 alpha-helix domain of DENV-2 E protein. Substitution of three amino acids from the DENV-2 sequence to the corresponding amino acids in the JEV sequence (I398L, M401A, and M412L) in the E-H1 was sufficient to promote extracellular secretion and resulted in detectable titers of DENV-2 VLP secretion.

21632767,2011 Aug,A single amino acid in nonstructural protein NS4B confers virulence to dengue virus in AG129 mice through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis.,"Dengue (DEN) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has become an increasing economic and health burden for the tropical and subtropical world. The lack of an appropriate animal model of DEN has greatly impeded the study of its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines/antivirals. We recently reported a DEN virus 2 (DENV-2) strain (D2Y98P) that lethally infects immunocompromised AG129 mice, resulting in organ damage or dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, hallmarks of severe DEN in patients (G. K. Tan et al., PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 4:e672, 2010). Here we report the identification of one critical virulence determinant of strain D2Y98P. By mutagenesis, we showed that a Phe-to-Leu alteration at amino acid position 52 in nonstructural protein NS4B completely abolished the pathogenicity of the D2Y98P virus, as evidenced by a lack of lethality and the absence of histological signs of disease, which correlated with reduced viral titers and intact vascular permeability. Conversely, a Leu-to-Phe alteration at position 52 of NS4B in nonvirulent DENV-2 strain TSV01 led to 80% lethality and increased viremia. The NS4B(Phe52) viruses displayed enhanced RNA synthesis in mammalian cells but not in mosquito cells. The increased viral RNA synthesis was independent of the ability of NS4B to interfere with the host type I interferon response. Overall, our results demonstrate that Phe at position 52 in NS4B confers virulence in mice on two independent DENV-2 strains through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis. In addition to providing further insights into the functional role of NS4B protein, our findings further support a direct relationship between viral loads and DEN pathogenesis in vivo, consistent with observations in DEN patients.

8474356,1993,Applications of polymerase chain reaction for identification of dengue viruses isolated from patient sera.,"A simple and sensitive procedure of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed previously such that all 4 serotypes of dengue viruses could be detected and their serotypes identified simultaneously in a single-step procedure. In this study we compared the RT-PCR with a conventional immunoperoxidase (PAP) staining method for the identification of dengue viruses currently isolated from patient sera. Sixty-six sera taken from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients were subjected to virus isolation by inoculating onto C6/36 cell cultures. Screening for the presence of dengue viruses in culture fluids was done after 7 days of incubation by PAP staining using hyperimmune rabbit anti-dengue virus antibody as the primary reagent. Dengue viruses in positive cultures were further identified for their serotypes by PAP using type-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and by RT-PCR. Thirty-two out of the 66 serum specimens tested (48.5%) were positive for dengue viruses. Of these, 5 were type 1 (DEN-1), 25 were type 2 (DEN-2) and 2 contained both DEN-1 and DEN-2. All cultures that were positive by PAP method were also positive by RT-PCR and vice versa. Thus, the results obtained by RT-PCR were in good agreement with those by PAP. It is important to point out that while all 5 DEN-1 isolates reacted readily with the MAb 1F1, only 2 of them could be identified by the MAb 15F3. Our data suggest that antigenic variation among DEN-1 isolates occur frequently and this should be taken into consideration in the selection of appropriate type-specific MAb for serotyping of dengue viruses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viremia/*diagnosis/microbiology']","['A simple and sensitive procedure of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed previously such that all 4 serotypes of dengue viruses could be detected and their serotypes identified simultaneously in a single-step procedure.', 'In this study we compared the RT-PCR with a conventional immunoperoxidase (PAP) staining method for the identification of dengue viruses currently isolated from patient sera.', 'Sixty-six sera taken from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients were subjected to virus isolation by inoculating onto C6/36 cell cultures.', 'Screening for the presence of dengue viruses in culture fluids was done after 7 days of incubation by PAP staining using hyperimmune rabbit anti-dengue virus antibody as the primary reagent.', 'Dengue viruses in positive cultures were further identified for their serotypes by PAP using type-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and by RT-PCR.', 'Thirty-two out of the 66 serum specimens tested (48.5%) were positive for dengue viruses.', 'Of these, 5 were type 1 (DEN-1), 25 were type 2 (DEN-2) and 2 contained both DEN-1 and DEN-2.', 'All cultures that were positive by PAP method were also positive by RT-PCR and vice versa.', 'Thus, the results obtained by RT-PCR were in good agreement with those by PAP.', 'It is important to point out that while all 5 DEN-1 isolates reacted readily with the MAb 1F1, only 2 of them could be identified by the MAb 15F3.', 'Our data suggest that antigenic variation among DEN-1 isolates occur frequently and this should be taken into consideration in the selection of appropriate type-specific MAb for serotyping of dengue viruses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)']"
15827155,2005 May,Dengue virus inhibits alpha interferon signaling by reducing STAT2 expression.,"Alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) is a key mediator of innate antiviral responses but has little effect on the established replication of dengue viruses, which are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of immense global health importance. Understanding how the IFN system is inhibited in dengue virus-infected cells would provide critical insights into disease pathogenesis. In a recent study analyzing the ability of individual dengue virus-encoded proteins to antagonize the IFN response, nonstructural (NS) protein 4B and possibly NS2A and NS4A were identified as candidate IFN antagonists. In monkey cells, NS4B appeared to inhibit both the IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma signal transduction pathways, which are distinct but overlapping (J. L. Munoz-Jordan, G. G. Sanchez-Burgos, M. Laurent-Rolle, and A. Garcia-Sastre, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:14333-14338, 2003). For this study, we examined the effects of dengue virus on the human IFN system, using cell lines that were stably transfected with self-replicating subgenomic dengue virus RNA (replicons) and that expressed all of the dengue virus nonstructural proteins together. We show here that in replicon-containing cells dengue virus RNA replication and the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, an IFN-sensitive virus, are resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-alpha. The presence of dengue virus replicons reduces global IFN-alpha-stimulated gene expression and specifically inhibits IFN-alpha but not IFN-gamma signal transduction. In cells containing replicons or infected with dengue virus, we found reduced levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), which is a key component of IFN-alpha but not IFN-gamma signaling. Collectively, these data show that dengue virus is capable of subverting the human IFN response by down-regulating STAT2 expression.

19460319,2009 Jul,Molecular evolution of dengue viruses: contributions of phylogenetics to understanding the history and epidemiology of the preeminent arboviral disease.,"Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most important arboviral pathogens in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world, putting at risk of infection nearly a third of the global human population. Evidence from the historical record suggests a long association between these viruses and humans. The transmission of DENV includes a sylvatic, enzootic cycle between nonhuman primates and arboreal mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, and an urban, endemic/epidemic cycle between Aedes aegypti, a mosquito with larval development in peridomestic water containers, and human reservoir hosts. DENV are members of the genus Flavivirus in the Family Flaviviridae and comprise of 4 antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV-1-4). Although they are nearly identical epidemiologically, the 4 DENV serotypes are genetically quite distinct. Utilization of phylogenetic analyses based on partial and/or complete genomic sequences has elucidated the origins, epidemiology (genetic diversity, transmission dynamics and epidemic potential), and the forces that shape DENV molecular evolution (rates of evolution, selection pressures, population sizes, putative recombination and evolutionary constraints) in nature. In this review, we examine how phylogenetics have improved understanding of DENV population dynamics and sizes at various stages of infection and transmission, and how this information may influence pathogenesis and improve our ability to understand and predict DENV emergence.

32783888,2020 Nov 1,"Unlike dengue virus, the conserved 14-23 residues in N-terminal region of Zika virus capsid is not involved in lipid interactions.","Zika virus capsid protein is involved in multiple essential steps of the viral life cycle. Many vital functionalities are attributed to the dynamic N- terminal domain of this protein, which is intrinsically disordered in ZIKV and among several flaviviruses too. Other than genome encapsulation, studies have shown interaction with host lipid droplets to be crucial for replication and maturation. In Dengue virus, the molecular basis of such interplay has been studied in detail, and residues within the capsid N-terminal disordered domain has been mapped. It revealed a new function of a conserved region in mediating capsid-lipid droplet association through a conformational transition. Therefore, in this study, we attempt to analyze the structural dynamics of Zika virus capsid's N- terminal domain and analyzed it through a reductionist approach by dividing the N-terminal domain into three truncated segments and studied them individually. Techniques such as Circular dichroism spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering, Zeta potential and Molecular dynamic simulations were employed to identify the motif responsible for structural flexibility and ability to interact with membrane models. Our results confirm that the truncated segments 5-26 and 1-30 readily adopt an α-helical conformation in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol, detergent and negatively charged phospholipids. However, in contrast to Dengue virus, we report the conserved residues 14-23 region to be unstructured and do not undergo a conformational switch in Zika virus.

26414178,2015,The Complete Genome Phylogeny of Geographically Distinct Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Isolates (1944-2013) Supports Further Groupings within the Cosmopolitan Genotype.,"Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) isolates have been implicated in deadly outbreaks of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in several regions of the world. Phylogenetic analysis of DENV-2 isolates collected from particular countries has been performed using partial or individual genes but only a few studies have examined complete whole-genome sequences collected worldwide. Herein, 50 complete genome sequences of DENV-2 isolates, reported over the past 70 years from 19 different countries, were downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted and evolutionary distances of the 50 DENV-2 isolates were determined using maximum likelihood (ML) trees or Bayesian phylogenetic analysis created from complete genome nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences or individual gene sequences. The results showed that all DENV-2 isolates fell into seven main groups containing five previously defined genotypes. A Cosmopolitan genotype showed further division into three groups (C-I, C-II, and C-III) with the C-I group containing two subgroups (C-IA and C-IB). Comparison of the aa sequences showed specific mutations among the various groups of DENV-2 isolates. A maximum number of aa mutations was observed in the NS5 gene, followed by the NS2A, NS3 and NS1 genes, while the smallest number of aa substitutions was recorded in the capsid gene, followed by the PrM/M, NS4A, and NS4B genes. Maximum evolutionary distances were found in the NS2A gene, followed by the NS4A and NS4B genes.

28348160,2017 Jun,The Race To Find Antivirals for Zika Virus.,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes, was an almost neglected pathogen until its introduction in the Americas in 2015 and its subsequent explosive spread throughout the continent, where it has infected millions of people. The virus has caused social and sanitary alarm, mainly due to its association with severe neurological disorders (Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly in fetuses and newborns). Nowadays, no specific antiviral therapy against ZIKV is available. However, during the past months, a great effort has been made to search for antiviral candidates using different approaches and methodologies, ranging from testing specific compounds with known antiviral activity to the screening of libraries with hundreds of bioactive molecules. The identified antiviral candidates include drugs targeting viral components as well as cellular ones. Here, an updated review of what has been done in this line is presented.

15956408,2005 Jun,Optimized diagnosis of acute dengue fever in Swedish travelers by a combination of reverse transcription-PCR and immunoglobulin M detection.,"The dengue viruses (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) are mosquito borne and cause 100 million cases of dengue fever each year in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Increased global travel has been accompanied by an increased import not only of dengue but also of severe fevers of unknown origin to Sweden. Fifty-seven Swedish travelers to dengue epidemic areas, with clinical and serologically diagnosed dengue fever, were included in this study. To find fast and reliable methods to diagnose dengue in the early phase of the disease, patient acute-phase sera were investigated for the presence of dengue-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also for dengue serotype (DEN-1 to DEN-4)-specific RNA by different PCR assays. The results showed that 15/20 (75%) of the samples collected 5 days or later post onset of disease, but only 5/37 (14%) of the samples collected on days 0 to 4, contained dengue-specific IgM. Of the samples collected on days 0 to 4 post onset, dengue RNAs of subtypes 1, 2, and 3 were detected by multiplex and/or by TaqMan PCR in 29/37 (78%); of these PCR-positive samples, 93% (27/29) were found IgM negative. By a combination of IgM ELISA and PCR assays, 84% (48/57) of the acute-phase samples were found to be positive.

21087501,2010 Nov 18,"Evolution of dengue virus type 3 genotype III in Venezuela: diversification, rates and population dynamics.","BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV are comprised of four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4) and each serotype can be divided in different genotypes. Currently, there is a dramatic emergence of DENV-3 genotype III in Latin America. Nevertheless, we still have an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary forces underlying the evolution of this genotype in this region of the world. In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic variability, rates and patterns of evolution of this genotype in Venezuela and the South American region, phylogenetic analysis, based on a large number (n = 119) of envelope gene sequences from DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela from 2001 to 2008, were performed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed an in situ evolution of DENV-3 genotype III following its introduction in the Latin American region, where three different genetic clusters (A to C) can be observed among the DENV-3 genotype III strains circulating in this region. Bayesian coalescent inference analyses revealed an evolutionary rate of 8.48 x 10⁻⁴ substitutions/site/year (s/s/y) for strains of cluster A, composed entirely of strains isolated in Venezuela. Amino acid substitution at position 329 of domain III of the E protein (A→V) was found in almost all E proteins from Cluster A strains. CONCLUSIONS: A significant evolutionary change between DENV-3 genotype III strains that circulated in the initial years of the introduction in the continent and strains isolated in the Latin American region in recent years was observed. The presence of DENV-3 genotype III strains belonging to different clusters was observed in Venezuela, revealing several introduction events into this country. The evolutionary rate found for Cluster A strains circulating in Venezuela is similar to the others previously established for this genotype in other regions of the world. This suggests a lack of correlation among DENV genotype III substitution rate and ecological pattern of virus spread.

31434193,2019 Aug 20,Molecular Epidemiology of Dengue in Panama: 25 Years of Circulation.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arbovirus in terms of human public health importance globally. In addition to DENV epidemiological surveillance, genomic surveillance may help investigators understand the epidemiological dynamics, geographic distribution, and temporal patterns of DENV circulation. Herein, we aimed to reconstruct the molecular epidemiology and phylogeny of DENV in Panama to connect the epidemiological history of DENV dispersal and circulation in Latin America. We retrospectively analyzed the epidemiological data obtained during 25 years of DENV surveillance in Panama. DENV was reintroduced in Panama in 1993 after a 35 year absence of autochthonous transmission. The increase in the number of total dengue cases has been accompanied by an increase in severe and fatal cases, with the highest case fatality rate recorded in 2011. All four serotypes were detected in Panama, which is characterized by serotype replacement and/or co-circulation of multiple serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of datasets collected from envelope (E) gene sequences obtained from viruses isolated from human sera demonstrated that circulating viruses were highly diverse and clustered in distinct clades, with co-circulation of clades from the same genotype. Our analyses also suggest that Panamanian strains were related to viruses from different regions of the Americas, suggesting a continuous exchange of viruses within the Americas. of Health Studies, Justo Arosemena avenue and 35st street, 0816-02593 Panama, Republic of Panama. of Health Studies, Justo Arosemena avenue and 35st street, 0816-02593 Panama, Republic of Panama. of Health Studies, Justo Arosemena avenue and 35st street, 0816-02593 Panama, Republic of Panama. of Health Studies, Justo Arosemena avenue and 35st street, 0816-02593 Panama, Republic of Panama. of Health Studies, Justo Arosemena avenue and 35st street, 0816-02593 Panama, Republic of Panama.

32121148,2020 Feb 28,Assessment of Prolonged Dengue Virus Infection in Dermal Fibroblasts and Hair-Follicle Dermal Papilla Cells.,"Dengue virus (DENV)-mediated hair loss is one of the post-dengue fatigue syndromes and its pathophysiology remains unknown. Whether long-term or persistent infection with DENV in the scalp results in hair loss is unclear. In this study, we cultured human dermal fibroblasts (WS1 cells) and primary human hair-follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) in the long term with DENV-2 infection. The production of virion, the expression of inflammatory and anti-virus genes, and their signaling transduction activity in the infected cells were analyzed. DENV-2 NS3 protein and DENV-2 5' UTR RNA were detected in fibroblasts and HFDPCs that were subjected to long-term infection with DENV-2 for 33 days. A significant amount of DENV-2 virion was produced by both WS1 cells and HFDPCs in the first two days of acute infection. The virion was also detected in WS1 cells that were infected in the long term, but HFDPCs failed to produce DENV-2 after long-term culture. Type I and type III interferons, and inflammatory cytokines were highly expressed in the acute phase of DENV infection in HFPDC and WS1 cells. However, in the long-term cultured cells, modest levels of anti-viral protein genes were expressed and we observed reduced signaling activity, which was correlated with the level of virus production changes. Long-term infection of DENV-2 downregulated the expression of hair growth regulatory factors, such as Rip1, Wnt1, and Wnt4. This in vitro study shows that the long-term infection with DENV-2 in dermal fibroblasts and dermal papilla cells may be involved with the prolonged-DENV-infection-mediated hair loss of post-dengue fatigue syndrome. However, direct evidence for viral replication in the human hair of a dengue victim or animal infection model is required. Taiwan. Taiwan. Taiwan. Taiwan.

16214197,2006 Jan 20,Inhibition of dengue virus translation and RNA synthesis by a morpholino oligomer targeted to the top of the terminal 3' stem-loop structure.,"Dengue virus (DEN) is a major public health problem worldwide and causes a spectrum of diseases, for which no antiviral treatments exist. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs) complementary to the DEN 5' stem-loop (5'SL) and to the DEN 3' cyclization sequence (3'CS) inhibit DEN replication, presumably by blocking critical RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions involved in viral translation and/or RNA synthesis. Here, a third P-PMO, complementary to the top of the 3' stem-loop (3'SLT), inhibited DEN replication in BHK cells. Using a novel DEN2 reporter replicon and a DEN2 reporter mRNA, we determined that the 5'SL P-PMO inhibited viral translation, the 3'CS P-PMO blocked viral RNA synthesis but not viral translation, and the 3'SLT P-PMO inhibited both viral translation and RNA synthesis. These results show that the 3'CS and the 3'SL domains regulate DEN translation and RNA synthesis and further demonstrate that P-PMOs are potentially useful as antiviral agents.

34484195,2021,Stochastic Model of the Adaptive Immune Response Predicts Disease Severity and Captures Enhanced Cross-Reactivity in Natural Dengue Infections.,"The dengue virus circulates as four distinct serotypes, where a single serotype infection is typically asymptomatic and leads to acquired immunity against that serotype. However, the developed immunity to one serotype is thought to underlie the severe manifestation of the disease observed in subsequent infections from a different serotype. We developed a stochastic model of the adaptive immune response to dengue infections. We first delineated the mechanisms initiating and sustaining adaptive immune responses during primary infections. We then contrasted these immune responses during secondary infections of either a homotypic or heterotypic serotype to understand the role of pre-existing and reactivated immune pathways on disease severity. Comparison of non-symptomatic and severe cases from heterotypic infections demonstrated that overproduction of specific antibodies during primary infection induces an enhanced population of cross-reactive antibodies during secondary infection, ultimately leading to severe disease manifestations. In addition, the level of disease severity was found to correlate with immune response kinetics, which was dependent on beginning lymphocyte levels. Our results detail the contribution of specific lymphocytes and antibodies to immunity and memory recall that lead to either protective or pathological outcomes, allowing for the understanding and determination of mechanisms of protective immunity.

25590713,2014 Dec,A two-plasmid strategy for engineering a dengue virus type 3 infectious clone from primary Brazilian isolate.,"Dengue infections represent one of the most prevalent arthropod-borne diseases worldwide, causing a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes. Engineered infectious clone is an important tool to study Dengue virus (DENV) biology. Functional full-length cDNA clones have been constructed for many positive-strand RNA viruses and have provided valuable tools for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in viral genome replication, virion assembly, virus pathogenesis and vaccine development. We report herein the successful development of an infectious clone from a primary Brazilian isolate of dengue virus 3 (DENV3) of the genotype III. Using a two-plasmid strategy, DENV3 genome was divided in two parts and cloned separately into a yeast-bacteria shuttle vector.

26927901,2016 Feb,"Laboratory-Enhanced Dengue Sentinel Surveillance in Colombo District, Sri Lanka: 2012-2014.","INTRODUCTION: Dengue has emerged as a significant public health problem in Sri Lanka. Historically surveillance was passive, with mandatory dengue notifications based on clinical diagnosis with only limited laboratory confirmation. To obtain more accurate data on the disease burden of dengue, we set up a laboratory-based enhanced sentinel surveillance system in Colombo District. Here we describe the study design and report our findings of enhanced surveillance in the years 2012-2014. METHODS: Three outpatient clinics and three government hospitals in Colombo District that covered most of the Colombo metropolitan area were selected for the sentinel surveillance system. Up to 60 patients per week presenting with an undifferentiated fever were enrolled. Acute blood samples from each patient were tested by dengue specific PCR, NS1 ELISA and IgM ELISA. A sub-set of samples was sent to Duke-NUS Singapore for quality assurance, virus isolation and serotyping. Trained medical research assistants used a standardized case report form to record clinical and epidemiological data. Clinical diagnoses by the clinicians-in-charge were recorded for hospitalized cases. RESULTS: Of 3,127 febrile cases, 43.6% were PCR and/or NS1 positive for dengue. A high proportion of lab confirmed dengue was observed from inpatients (IPD) (53.9%) compared to outpatient (clinics in hospitals and general practice) (7.6%). Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) was diagnosed in 11% of patients at the time of first contact, and the median day of illness at time of presentation to the sentinel sites was 4. Dengue serotype 1 was responsible for 85% of the cases and serotype 4 for 15%. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinicians' presumptive diagnosis of dengue was 84% and 34%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DENV-1, and to a lesser degree DENV-4, infection were responsible for a high proportion of febrile illnesses in Colombo in the years 2012 to 2014. Clinicians' diagnoses were associated with high sensitivity, but laboratory confirmation is required to enhance specificity. Singapore. Singapore. Health, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.

22197424,2012 Feb,Development of Dengue type-2 virus replicons expressing GFP reporter gene in study of viral RNA replication.,"Insertion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoding-gene into virus genes has provided a valuable tool for flavivirus research. This study aimed to develop dengue virus (DENV) replicons expressing GFP reporter that would provide a fast in vitro system to analyze functional roles of specific DENV sequences in viral replication. Two classes of recombinant replicon constructs were generated; one was a RNA-launched replicon with a GFP gene directly inserted into a full-length DENV genome (FL-DENV/GFP), and the other consisted of 4 types of DNA-launched DENV subgenomic replicons with GFP replacement at various structural genes (Δ-DENV/GFP). The FL-DENV/GFP resulted in GFP expression in transfected cells with no viable DENV being recovered from the transfection. The Δ-DENV/GFP constructs with partial structural gene deletion (ΔC-, ΔCprM/M-, ΔprM/M-, or ΔE-) expressed bright and long lasting GFP. The GFP expression intensity in living cells correlated well with the level of RNA replication. Various mutations in the 5'noncoding region of DENV-2 previously shown to be important genetic determinants for virus replication and mouse virulence were incorporated into the 5 different replicon constructs. Characterizations of 29 mutants demonstrated that these replicons can provide a useful platform for a quick and powerful in vitro system to analyze genetic determinants of DENV replication. These constructs can also be useful for development of vectors expressing foreign genes for various researches.

30041666,2018 Jul 24,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of a dengue virus serotype 3 isolated from a Chinese traveler returned from Laos.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection caused by international visitors has become a public health concern in China. Although sporadic imported cases of DENV have been documented in Yunnan, China since 2000, a complete genome sequence of dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) imported from Laos is still not available. Here, we report the first complete genome sequence and genomic characterization of a DENV-3 strain (YNPE3) isolated from a patient returned from Laos. METHODS: Viral isolation from the patient's serum was performed using mosquitoes C6/36 cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for identification and serotyping of the virus. The complete sequence was determined by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Homology analysis was implemented by NCBI-BLAST. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MegAlign module of the Lasergene 7 software package DNASTAR. MFOLD software was used to predict the RNA secondary structure of 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR. Phylogenetic analysis, which was based on envelope gene and complete coding sequence, was performed by Maximum-Likelihood method. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the virus belonged to dengue virus serotype 3, which was named YNPE3 strain. The full-length genome of the YNPE3 strain was 10,627 nucleotides (nts) with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 3390 amino acids. Strain YNPE3 shared 98.6-98.8% nucleotide identity with the closely related strains isolated in India (JQ922556, KU216209, KU216208). We observed the deletion of about 40 nts in the 5' UTR and 3' UTR of strain YNPE3, and 11 nts (ACGCAGGAAGT) insertion that was present in the 3' UTR of YNPE3. Compared with prototype strain H87, abundant amino acid substitutions in the YNPE3 strain were observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the YNPE3 strain belonged to genotype III of DENV-3, and that it might be closely related with genotype III strains isolated in Laos and India. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the complete genome sequence and molecular characterization of a DENV-3 isolate imported from Laos. The presented results can further promote disease surveillance, and epidemiological and evolutionary studies of the DENV-3 in Yunnan province of China. Union Medical College, Kunming, 650118, China.

30445298,2019 Feb 1,Multichannel digital heteronuclear magnetic resonance biosensor.,"Low-field, mobile NMR systems are increasingly used across diverse fields, including medical diagnostics, food quality control, and forensics. The throughput and functionality of these systems, however, are limited due to their conventional single-channel detection: one NMR probe exclusively uses an NMR console at any given time. Under this design, multi-channel detection could only be accomplished by either serially accessing individual probes or stacking up multiple copies of NMR electronics; this approach still retains limitations such as long assay times and increased system complexity. Here we present a new scalable architecture, HERMES (hetero-nuclear resonance multichannel electronic system), for versatile, high-throughput NMR analyses. HERMES exploits the concept of software-defined radio by virtualizing NMR electronics in the digital domain. This strategy i) creates multiple NMR consoles without adding extra hardware; ii) acquires signals from multiple NMR channels in parallel; and iii) operates in wide frequency ranges. All of these functions could be realized on-demand in a single compact device. We interfaced HERMES with an array of NMR probes; the combined system simultaneously measured NMR relaxation from multiple samples and resolved spectra of hetero-nuclear spins ((1)H, (19)F, (13)C). For potential diagnostic uses, we applied the system to detect dengue fever and molecularly profile cancer cells through multi-channel protein assays. HERMES holds promise as a powerful analytical tool that enables rapid, reconfigurable, and parallel detection.

11559795,2001 Oct,Mutagenesis of the Dengue virus type 2 NS3 protein within and outside helicase motifs: effects on enzyme activity and virus replication.,"The protein NS3 of Dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) is the second largest nonstructural protein specified by the virus and is known to possess multiple enzymatic activities, including a serine proteinase located in the N-terminal region and an NTPase-helicase in the remaining 70% of the protein. The latter region has seven conserved helicase motifs found in all members of the family Flaviviridae. DEN-2 NS3 lacking the proteinase region was synthesized as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli. The effects of 10 mutations on ATPase and RNA helicase activity were examined. Residues at four sites within enzyme motifs I, II, and VI were substituted, and six sites outside motifs were altered by clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis. The mutations were also tested for their effects on virus replication by incorporation into genomic-length cDNA. Two mutations, both in motif I (G198A and K199A) abolished both ATPase and helicase activity. Two further mutations, one in motif VI (R457A,R458A) and the other a clustered charged-to-alanine substitution at R(376)KNGK(380), abolished helicase activity only. No virus was detected for any mutation which prevented helicase activity, demonstrating the requirement of this enzyme for virus replication. The remaining six mutations resulted in various levels of enzyme activities, and four permitted virus replication. For the two nonreplicating viruses encoding clustered changes at R(184)KR(186) and D(436)GEE(439), we propose that the substituted residues are surface located and that the viruses are defective through altered interaction of NS3 with other components of the viral replication complex. Two of the replicating viruses displayed a temperature-sensitive phenotype. One contained a clustered mutation at D(334)EE(336) and grew too poorly for further characterization. However, virus with an M283F substitution in motif II was examined in a temperature shift experiment (33 to 37 degrees C) and showed reduced RNA synthesis at the higher temperature.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Alanine/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Temperature', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']","['The protein NS3 of Dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) is the second largest nonstructural protein specified by the virus and is known to possess multiple enzymatic activities, including a serine proteinase located in the N-terminal region and an NTPase-helicase in the remaining 70% of the protein.', 'The latter region has seven conserved helicase motifs found in all members of the family Flaviviridae.', 'DEN-2 NS3 lacking the proteinase region was synthesized as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli.', 'The effects of 10 mutations on ATPase and RNA helicase activity were examined.', 'Residues at four sites within enzyme motifs I, II, and VI were substituted, and six sites outside motifs were altered by clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis.', 'The mutations were also tested for their effects on virus replication by incorporation into genomic-length cDNA.', 'Two mutations, both in motif I (G198A and K199A) abolished both ATPase and helicase activity.', 'Two further mutations, one in motif VI (R457A,R458A) and the other a clustered charged-to-alanine substitution at R(376)KNGK(380), abolished helicase activity only.', 'No virus was detected for any mutation which prevented helicase activity, demonstrating the requirement of this enzyme for virus replication.', 'The remaining six mutations resulted in various levels of enzyme activities, and four permitted virus replication.', 'For the two nonreplicating viruses encoding clustered changes at R(184)KR(186) and D(436)GEE(439), we propose that the substituted residues are surface located and that the viruses are defective through altered interaction of NS3 with other components of the viral replication complex.', 'Two of the replicating viruses displayed a temperature-sensitive phenotype.', 'One contained a clustered mutation at D(334)EE(336) and grew too poorly for further characterization.', 'However, virus with an M283F substitution in motif II was examined in a temperature shift experiment (33 to 37 degrees C) and showed reduced RNA synthesis at the higher temperature.']"
27992765,2017 Feb,Kinetics of the association of dengue virus capsid protein with the granular component of nucleolus.,"Dengue virus (DENV) replicates in the cytoplasm but translocation of the capsid protein (C) to the nucleoli of infected cells has been shown to facilitate virus multiplication for DENV-2. This study demonstrates that the nucleolar localization of C occurs with all four serotypes of DENV. The interaction of C with the nucleolus was found to be dynamic with a mobile fraction of 66% by FRAP. That the C shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm was suggested by FLIP and translation inhibition experiments. Colocalization with B23 indicated that DENV C targeted the granular component (GC) of the nucleolus. Presence of DENV C in the nucleolus affected the recovery kinetics of B23 in infected and transfected cells. Sub-nucleolar localization of DENV C of all serotypes to the GC, its mobility in and out of the nucleolus and its affect on the dynamics of B23 is being shown for the first time. Maharashtra, India.

21703015,2011 Jun 26,Molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses in southern China from 1978 to 2006.,"To investigate molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses (DENV) in southern China, a total of 14 dengue isolates were collected in southern China during each epidemic year between 1978 and 2006 and their full-length genome sequences were obtained by using RT-PCR method. The E gene sequences from additional 6 dengue fever patients in Guangzhou in 2006 were also obtained by using RT-PCR method. Combined with DENVs sequences published in GenBank, phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis were performed. One hundred and twenty-five E gene sequences and 60 complete genome sequences published in the GenBank were also involved. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there was a wide genetic diversity of DENVs isolated in southern China. DENV-1 strains exist in almost all of the clades of genotype I and IV except the Asia 1 clade of genotype I; DENV-2 stains are grouped into four of the five genotypes except American genotype. DENV-4 strains are grouped into 2 genotypes (I and II). Phylogenetic analysis also showed that all DENV-4 isolates and two DENV-2 isolates were closely related to the prior isolates from neighboring Southeast Asia countries. The DENV-1 strain isolated during the 2006 epidemic is highly homologous to the strains isolated during the 2001 epidemic.Recombination analysis showed no inter-serotype recombination, but 22 intra-serotype recombination events were found across the 32 complete genomes of all Chinese isolates.

30419004,2018,Emergence of genotype Cosmopolitan of dengue virus type 2 and genotype III of dengue virus type 3 in Thailand.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has spread to over 100 countries. Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV comprises 4 serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), and each serotype is divided into distinct genotypes. Thailand is an endemic area where all 4 serotypes of DENV co-circulate. To understand the current genotype distribution of DENVs in Thailand, we enrolled 100 cases of fever with dengue-like symptoms at the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute during 2016-2017. Among them, 37 cases were shown to be dengue-positive by real-time PCR. We were able to isolate DENVs from 21 cases, including 1 DENV-1, 8 DENV-2, 4 DENV-3, and 8 DENV-4. To investigate the divergence of the viruses, RNA was extracted from isolated DENVs and viral near-whole genome sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained viral sequences revealed that DENV-2 genotype Cosmopolitan was co-circulating with DENV-2 genotype Asian-I, the previously predominating genotype in Thailand. Furthermore, DENV-3 genotype III was found instead of DENV-3 genotype II. The DENV-2 Cosmopolitan and DENV-3 genotype III found in Thailand were closely related to the respective strains found in nearby countries. These results indicated that DENVs in Thailand have increased in genotypic diversity, and suggested that the DENV genotypic shift observed in other Asian countries also might be taking place in Thailand.

23360780,2013 Jan 29,"Lineage shift in Indian strains of Dengue virus serotype-3 (Genotype III), evidenced by detection of lineage IV strains in clinical cases from Kerala.","BACKGROUND: Local epidemiology of Dengue is defined by the genetic diversity of the circulating Dengue virus (DENV) strains. This important information is not available for the virus strains from most parts of the Indian subcontinent. The present study focused on the genetic diversity of the serotype 3 DENV strains (DENV-3) from India. RESULTS: A total of 22 DENV-3 strains identified by reverse-transcription PCR analysis of serum samples from 709 patients were studied. These samples were collected over a period of 4 years (2008-2011) from dengue fever suspected patients from Kerala, a dengue endemic state in South India. Comparison of a 1740bp nucleotide sequence of the viral Capsid-Pre-membrane-Envelope coding region of our strains and previously reported DENV-3 strains from India, South Asia and South America revealed non-synonymous substitutions that were genotype III-specific as well as sporadic. Evidence of positive selection was detected in the I81 amino acid residue of the envelope protein. Out of the 22 samples, three had I81A and 18 had I81V substitutions. In the phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood method the strains from Kerala clustered in two different lineages (lineage III and IV) within genotype III clade of DENV-3 strains. The ten strains that belonged to lineage IV had a signature amino acid substitution T219A in the envelope protein. Interestingly, all these strains were found to be closely related to a Singapore strain GU370053 isolated in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies for the first time the presence of lineage IV strains in the Indian subcontinent. Results indicate the possibility of a recent exotic introduction and also a shift from the existing lineage III strains to lineage IV. Lineage shifts in DENV-3 strains have been attributed to dramatic increase in disease severity in many parts of the world. Hence the present observation could be significant in terms of the clinical severity of future dengue cases in the region.

20862256,2010 Sep 17,Crystal structure of the dengue virus methyltransferase bound to a 5'-capped octameric RNA.,The N-terminal domain of the flavivirus NS5 protein functions as a methyltransferase (MTase). It sequentially methylates the N7 and 2'-O positions of the viral RNA cap structure (GpppA→(7me)GpppA→(7me)GpppA(2'-O-me)). The same NS5 domain could also have a guanylyltransferase activity (GTP+ppA-RNA→GpppA). The mechanism by which this protein domain catalyzes these three distinct functions is currently unknown. Here we report the crystallographic structure of DENV-3 MTase in complex with a 5'-capped RNA octamer (G(ppp)AGAACCUG) at a resolution of 2.9 A. Two RNA octamers arranged as kissing loops are encircled by four MTase monomers around a 2-fold non-crystallography symmetry axis. Only two of the four monomers make direct contact with the 5' end of RNA. The RNA structure is stabilised by the formation of several intra and intermolecular base stacking and non-canonical base pairs. The structure may represent the product of guanylylation of the viral genome prior to the subsequent methylation events that require repositioning of the RNA substrate to reach to the methyl-donor sites. The crystal structure provides a structural explanation for the observed trans-complementation of MTases with different methylation defects.

23355615,2013 Mar 1,MCPIP1 ribonuclease exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral effects through viral RNA binding and degradation.,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1), belonging to the MCPIP family with highly conserved CCCH-type zinc finger and Nedd4-BP1, YacP Nuclease domains, has been implicated in negative regulation of the cellular inflammatory responses. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that this RNA-binding nuclease also targets viral RNA and possesses potent antiviral activities. Overexpression of the human MCPIP1, but not MCPIP2, MCPIP3 or MCPIP4, inhibited Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DEN) replication. The functional analysis of MCPIP1 revealed that the activities of RNase, RNA binding and oligomerization, but not deubiqutinase, are required for its antiviral potential. Furthermore, infection of other positive-sense RNA viruses, such as sindbis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus, and negative-sense RNA virus, such as influenza virus, as well as DNA virus, such as adenovirus, can also be blocked by MCPIP1. Moreover, the endogenous MCPIP1 gene expression was induced by JEV and DEN infection, and knockdown of MCPIP1 expression enhanced the replication of JEV and DEN in human cells. Thus, MCPIP1 can act as a host innate defense via RNase activity for targeting and degrading viral RNA.

26569594,2016 Feb 2,Insights into the molecular evolution of Dengue virus type 4 in Puerto Rico over two decades of emergence.,"Dengue has emerged globally as a major human health problem since the 1950s and is now the most important arboviral disease of humans, infecting nearly 400 million people annually. While some cases are asymptomatic, others can develop a febrile illness (dengue fever) or even progress to severe and fatal dengue. Dengue is caused by any of 4 closely related but distinct viruses, known as Dengue virus serotype 1 to 4 (DENV-1 to DENV-4) which are maintained in endemic transmission to humans in large urban centers of the tropics by Aedes mosquitoes. Since the early 1960s, Puerto Rico, a major metropolitan center in the Caribbean, has experienced increasingly larger and clinically more severe epidemics following the introduction of all four dengue serotypes. The first dengue hemorrhagic fever epidemic in 1986, and a particularly severe outbreak in 1998 were dominated by novel DENV-4 strains that evolved in Puerto Rico, replacing earlier strains and spreading throughout the region. Sequence characterization of 54 complete DENV-4 genomes and their comparative evolution against 74 previously published viral sequences from the region over several decades shows that DENV-4 strains from these periods were genetically distinct based on unique changes in the envelope and non-structural genes. Their replacement of earlier strains in Puerto Rico progressed rapidly, suggesting that strong natural selection played a role in their fixation. This study confirms that DENVs evolve through rapid lineage turnover driven in part by natural selection and genetic drift.

However, a thorough understanding of the host response to these viruses is lacking, partly because conventional approaches ignore heterogeneity in virus abundance across cells. We present viscRNA-Seq (virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq), an approach to probe the host transcriptome together with intracellular viral RNA at the single cell level. We applied viscRNA-Seq to monitor dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered extreme heterogeneity in virus abundance. We exploited this variation to identify host factors that show complex dynamics and a high degree of specificity for either virus, including proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum translocon, signal peptide processing, and membrane trafficking.

17597456,2007 Aug 1,Maternal antibody and viral factors in the pathogenesis of dengue virus in infants.,"The pathogenesis of dengue in infants is poorly understood. We postulated that dengue severity in infants would be positively associated with markers of viral burden and that maternally derived, neutralizing anti-dengue antibody would have decayed before the age at which infants with dengue presented to the hospital. In 75 Vietnamese infants with primary dengue, we found significant heterogeneity in viremia and NS1 antigenemia at hospital presentation, and these factors were independent of disease grade or continuous measures of disease severity. Neutralizing antibody titers, predicted in each infant at the time of their illness, suggested that the majority of infants (65%) experienced dengue hemorrhagic fever when the maternally derived neutralizing antibody titer had declined to <1 : 20. Collectively, these data have important implications for dengue vaccine research because they suggest that viral burden may not solely explain severe dengue in infants and that neutralizing antibody is a reasonable but not absolute marker of protective immunity in infants.

26325059,2015,Tracking Dengue Virus Intra-host Genetic Diversity during Human-to-Mosquito Transmission.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection of an individual human or mosquito host produces a dynamic population of closely-related sequences. This intra-host genetic diversity is thought to offer an advantage for arboviruses to adapt as they cycle between two very different host species, but it remains poorly characterized. To track changes in viral intra-host genetic diversity during horizontal transmission, we infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by allowing them to feed on DENV2-infected patients. We then performed whole-genome deep-sequencing of human- and matched mosquito-derived DENV samples on the Illumina platform and used a sensitive variant-caller to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within each sample. >90% of SNVs were lost upon transition from human to mosquito, as well as from mosquito abdomen to salivary glands. Levels of viral diversity were maintained, however, by the regeneration of new SNVs at each stage of transmission. We further show that SNVs maintained across transmission stages were transmitted as a unit of two at maximum, suggesting the presence of numerous variant genomes carrying only one or two SNVs each. We also present evidence for differences in selection pressures between human and mosquito hosts, particularly on the structural and NS1 genes. This analysis provides insights into how population drops during transmission shape RNA virus genetic diversity, has direct implications for virus evolution, and illustrates the value of high-coverage, whole-genome next-generation sequencing for understanding viral intra-host genetic diversity.

33976375,2021 May 11,Dengue virus-free defective interfering particles have potent and broad anti-dengue virus activity.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is spread from human to human through the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito and leads to about 100 million clinical infections yearly. Treatment options and vaccine availability for DENV are limited. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are considered a promising antiviral approach but infectious virus contamination has limited their development. Here, a DENV-derived DIP production cell line was developed that continuously produced DENV-free DIPs. The DIPs contained and could deliver to cells a DENV serotype 2 subgenomic defective-interfering RNA, which was originally discovered in DENV infected patients. The DIPs released into cell culture supernatant were purified and could potently inhibit replication of all DENV serotypes in cells. Antiviral therapeutics are limited for many viral infection.

7251133,1981 May,Evidence for two mechanisms of dengue virus infection of adherent human monocytes: trypsin-sensitive virus receptors and trypsin-resistant immune complex receptors.,"Trypsin treatment of adherent human monocytes greatly reduced or eliminated the ability of these cells to support dengue virus replication. However, addition of dilute (nonneutralizing) antibody to the inoculum and the culture medium resulted in viral yields similar to those from monocytes not treated with trypsin. These results suggested that viral entry was facilitated by phagocytosis of immune complexes via Fc receptors on the monocytes. This concept was tested by (i) pretreating monocytes with aggregated gamma globulin, which resulted in a 40-fold reduction of viral yields after infection with dilute antibody-virus complexes and (ii) forming an immune complex with virus, antivirus F(ab')2 fragments, and rabbit anti-human Fab. Whereas F(ab')2 fragments alone would not enhance virus replication in trypsin-treated monocytes, the immune complex containing a rabbit Fc piece did increase the yield of dengue virus.

26709822,2015 Dec,Cissampelos pareira Linn: Natural Source of Potent Antiviral Activity against All Four Dengue Virus Serotypes.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant global public health risk. In tropical countries such as India where periodic dengue outbreaks can be correlated to the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of all four dengue viruses (DENVs) and the high population density, a drug for dengue is being increasingly recognized as an unmet public health need. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the knowledge of traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, we developed a systematic bioassay-guided screening approach to explore the indigenous herbal bio-resource to identify plants with pan-DENV inhibitory activity. Our results show that the alcoholic extract of Cissampelos pariera Linn (Cipa extract) was a potent inhibitor of all four DENVs in cell-based assays, assessed in terms of viral NS1 antigen secretion using ELISA, as well as viral replication, based on plaque assays. Virus yield reduction assays showed that Cipa extract could decrease viral titers by an order of magnitude. The extract conferred statistically significant protection against DENV infection using the AG129 mouse model. A preliminary evaluation of the clinical relevance of Cipa extract showed that it had no adverse effects on platelet counts and RBC viability. In addition to inherent antipyretic activity in Wistar rats, it possessed the ability to down-regulate the production of TNF-α, a cytokine implicated in severe dengue disease. Importantly, it showed no evidence of toxicity in Wistar rats, when administered at doses as high as 2g/Kg body weight for up to 1 week. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings above, taken in the context of the human safety of Cipa, based on its use in Indian traditional medicine, warrant further work to explore Cipa as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation for dengue therapy.

22072762,2012 Jan,Uncoupling cis-Acting RNA elements from coding sequences revealed a requirement of the N-terminal region of dengue virus capsid protein in virus particle formation.,"Little is known about the mechanism of flavivirus genome encapsidation. Here, functional elements of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) protein were investigated. Study of the N-terminal region of DENV C has been limited by the presence of overlapping cis-acting RNA elements within the protein-coding region. To dissociate these two functions, we used a recombinant DENV RNA with a duplication of essential RNA structures outside the C coding sequence. By the use of this system, the highly conserved amino acids FNML, which are encoded in the RNA cyclization sequence 5'CS, were found to be dispensable for C function. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of C impaired DENV particle formation. Two clusters of basic residues (R5-K6-K7-R9 and K17-R18-R20-R22) were identified as important. A systematic mutational analysis indicated that a high density of positive charges, rather than particular residues at specific positions, was necessary. Furthermore, a differential requirement of N-terminal sequences of C for viral particle assembly was observed in mosquito and human cells. While no viral particles were observed in human cells with a virus lacking the first 18 residues of C, DENV propagation was detected in mosquito cells, although to a level about 50-fold less than that observed for a wild-type (WT) virus. We conclude that basic residues at the N terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but that they are crucial for propagation in human cells. This is the first report demonstrating that the N terminus of C plays a role in DENV particle formation. In addition, our results suggest that this function of C is differentially modulated in different host cells.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dengue/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Open Reading Frames', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Virus Assembly']","['Little is known about the mechanism of flavivirus genome encapsidation.', 'Here, functional elements of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) protein were investigated.', 'Study of the N-terminal region of DENV C has been limited by the presence of overlapping cis-acting RNA elements within the protein-coding region.', 'To dissociate these two functions, we used a recombinant DENV RNA with a duplication of essential RNA structures outside the C coding sequence.', ""By the use of this system, the highly conserved amino acids FNML, which are encoded in the RNA cyclization sequence 5'CS, were found to be dispensable for C function."", 'In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of C impaired DENV particle formation.', 'Two clusters of basic residues (R5-K6-K7-R9 and K17-R18-R20-R22) were identified as important.', 'A systematic mutational analysis indicated that a high density of positive charges, rather than particular residues at specific positions, was necessary.', 'Furthermore, a differential requirement of N-terminal sequences of C for viral particle assembly was observed in mosquito and human cells.', 'While no viral particles were observed in human cells with a virus lacking the first 18 residues of C, DENV propagation was detected in mosquito cells, although to a level about 50-fold less than that observed for a wild-type (WT) virus.', 'We conclude that basic residues at the N terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but that they are crucial for propagation in human cells.', 'This is the first report demonstrating that the N terminus of C plays a role in DENV particle formation.', 'In addition, our results suggest that this function of C is differentially modulated in different host cells.']"
19004935,2009 Jan,Structural and functional studies of the promoter element for dengue virus RNA replication.,"The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the dengue virus (DENV) genome contains two defined elements essential for viral replication. At the 5' end, a large stem-loop (SLA) structure functions as the promoter for viral polymerase activity. Next to the SLA, there is a short stem-loop that contains a cyclization sequence known as the 5' upstream AUG region (5'UAR). Here, we analyzed the secondary structure of the SLA in solution and the structural requirements of this element for viral replication. Using infectious DENV clones, viral replicons, and in vitro polymerase assays, we defined two helical regions, a side stem-loop, a top loop, and a U bulge within SLA as crucial elements for viral replication. The determinants for SLA-polymerase recognition were found to be common in different DENV serotypes. In addition, structural elements within the SLA required for DENV RNA replication were also conserved among different mosquito- and tick-borne flavivirus genomes, suggesting possible common strategies for polymerase-promoter recognition in flaviviruses. Furthermore, a conserved oligo(U) track present downstream of the SLA was found to modulate RNA synthesis in transfected cells. In vitro polymerase assays indicated that a sequence of at least 10 residues following the SLA, upstream of the 5'UAR, was necessary for efficient RNA synthesis using the viral 3'UTR as template.","[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics', '*Virus Replication']","[""The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the dengue virus (DENV) genome contains two defined elements essential for viral replication."", ""At the 5' end, a large stem-loop (SLA) structure functions as the promoter for viral polymerase activity."", ""Next to the SLA, there is a short stem-loop that contains a cyclization sequence known as the 5' upstream AUG region (5'UAR)."", 'Here, we analyzed the secondary structure of the SLA in solution and the structural requirements of this element for viral replication.', 'Using infectious DENV clones, viral replicons, and in vitro polymerase assays, we defined two helical regions, a side stem-loop, a top loop, and a U bulge within SLA as crucial elements for viral replication.', 'The determinants for SLA-polymerase recognition were found to be common in different DENV serotypes.', 'In addition, structural elements within the SLA required for DENV RNA replication were also conserved among different mosquito- and tick-borne flavivirus genomes, suggesting possible common strategies for polymerase-promoter recognition in flaviviruses.', 'Furthermore, a conserved oligo(U) track present downstream of the SLA was found to modulate RNA synthesis in transfected cells.', ""In vitro polymerase assays indicated that a sequence of at least 10 residues following the SLA, upstream of the 5'UAR, was necessary for efficient RNA synthesis using the viral 3'UTR as template.""]"
27855153,2016 Nov,Drivers of Inter-individual Variation in Dengue Viral Load Dynamics.,"Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease of humans that endemically circulates in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Infection with dengue can result in a range of disease outcomes. A considerable amount of research has sought to improve our understanding of this variation in disease outcomes and to identify predictors of severe disease. Contributing to this research, patterns of viral load in dengue infected patients have been quantified, with analyses indicating that peak viral load levels, rates of viral load decline, and time to peak viremia are useful predictors of severe disease. Here, we take a complementary approach to understanding patterns of clinical manifestation and inter-individual variation in viral load dynamics. Specifically, we statistically fit mathematical within-host models of dengue to individual-level viral load data to test virological and immunological hypotheses explaining inter-individual variation in dengue viral load. We choose between alternative models using model selection criteria to determine which hypotheses are best supported by the data. We first show that the cellular immune response plays an important role in regulating viral load in secondary dengue infections. We then provide statistical support for the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (but not original antigenic sin) in the development of severe disease in secondary dengue infections. Finally, we show statistical support for serotype-specific differences in viral infectivity rates, with infectivity rates of dengue serotypes 2 and 3 exceeding those of serotype 1. These results contribute to our understanding of dengue viral load patterns and their relationship to the development of severe dengue disease. They further have implications for understanding how dengue transmissibility may depend on the immune status of infected individuals and the identity of the infecting serotype.

It also exhibits low activity against a few other RNA viruses, but is highly active against yellow fever virus, a related flavivirus.

17229857,2007 Mar,Use of capillary blood samples as a new approach for diagnosis of Dengue virus infection.,"We evaluated the use of capillary blood samples stored on filter papers for diagnosis of dengue virus infection. Venous and capillary blood samples were collected from 130 patients suspected of having dengue fever. We compared the performances of standard reference methods using capillary blood samples absorbed onto filter papers versus venous blood samples. The resulting sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of tests performed on filter paper compared to those performed on venous blood samples were 81.6% (62/76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 74.9% to 88.3%), 90.7% (49/54; 95% CI, 85.7% to 95.7%), and 92.5% (62/67; 95% CI, 86.2% to 98.8%), respectively. During the acute phase of dengue virus infection (day 1 to day 4), the tests performed on capillary blood samples had a sensitivity of 88.5% (95% CI, 82.0% to 95.0%) and a specificity of 93.8% (95% CI, 88.9% to 98.7%). During the convalescent phase of infection, this method allowed the viral serotype to be determined for 4 of 15 (27%) dengue virus-infected patients for whom virological diagnosis using venous samples was negative. Capillary blood samples could therefore be a good alternative for the diagnosis of dengue virus infection in tropical areas. Indeed, these samples are convenient for storage and transport without the need for a cold chain and simplify the collection of samples from children.

18606243,2008 Aug-Sep,Induction of p53-dependent and mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway by dengue virus infection of human and animal cells.,"Previous studies have suggested that cells undergo apoptosis in response to dengue virus infection. However, the potential significance of dengue virus-induced apoptosis and the pathways are still not clearly defined. In this study, comparative analysis of dengue virus-induced apoptosis in BHK, H1299, HUH-7 and Vero cell lines was carried out. We show here that infection of BHK, HUH-7 and Vero cell lines with dengue type 1 virus (DEN1V) induces cell death typical of apoptosis. Virus-induced cell death was assayed by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, detection of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, DNA content analysis and assay for the externalization of phosphatidylserine residues.

27572397,2016 Nov,"N-Desmethylclozapine, Fluoxetine, and Salmeterol Inhibit Postentry Stages of the Dengue Virus Life Cycle.","Around 10,000 people die each year due to severe dengue disease, and two-thirds of the world population lives in a region where dengue disease is endemic. There has been remarkable progress in dengue virus vaccine development; however, there are no licensed antivirals for dengue disease, and none appear to be in clinical trials. We took the approach of repositioning approved drugs for anti-dengue virus activity by screening a library of pharmacologically active compounds. We identified N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and salmeterol xinafoate as dengue virus inhibitors based on reductions in the numbers of infected cells and viral titers. Dengue virus RNA levels were diminished in inhibitor-treated cells, and this effect was specific to dengue virus, as other flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, or other RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus, were not affected by these inhibitors. All three inhibitors specifically inhibited dengue virus replication with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) in the high-nanomolar range. Estimation of negative-strand RNA intermediates and time-of-addition experiments indicated that inhibition was occurring at a postentry stage, most probably at the initiation of viral RNA replication.

19793816,2009 Dec,"Dengue virus infection induces upregulation of GRP78, which acts to chaperone viral antigen production.","Dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis is related to the host responses to viral infection within target cells, and therefore, this study assessed intracellular changes in host proteins following DENV infection. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified upregulation of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone GRP78 in K562 cells following DENV infection, in the absence of virus-induced cell death. Upregulation of GRP78 in DENV-infected cells was confirmed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy and by Western blot analysis and was also observed in DENV-infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages, a natural target cell type for DENV infection. GRP78 was upregulated in both DENV antigen-positive and -negative cells in the DENV-infected culture, suggesting a bystander effect, with the highest GRP78 levels coincident with high-level DENV antigen production and infectious-virus release. Transfection of target cells to express GRP78 prior to DENV challenge did not affect subsequent DENV infection, but cleavage of GRP78 with the SubAB toxin, during an established DENV infection, yielded a 10- to 100-fold decrease in infectious-virus release, loss of intracellular DENV particles, and a dramatic decrease in intracellular DENV antigen. However, DENV RNA levels were unchanged, indicating normal DENV RNA replication but altered DENV antigen levels in the absence of GRP78. Thus, GRP78 is upregulated by DENV infection and is necessary for DENV antigen production and/or accumulation. This may be a common requirement for viruses such as flaviviruses that depend heavily on the ER for coordinated protein production and processing.

32272263,2020 Jun,Rapid visual detection of dengue virus by combining reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification with lateral-flow dipstick assay.,"OBJECTIVES: Dengue caused by infection with the dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and of greatest public health concern. With more large outbreaks in rural areas, the purpose of this study was to develop a point-of-care test using recombinase-aided amplification and lateral-flow dipsticks for rapidly detecting DENV in low-resource settings. METHODS: The primers for the recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay were designed based on 3' UTR of the DENV genome and screened. The RAA temperature, time and the concentration of primers were then optimized, as well as the lateral-flow dipstick assay (LFD) time. Finally, the diagnostic performance of the reverse transcription (RT)-RAA-LFD assay was evaluated using blood samples from 247 patients who were clinically suspected to be infected with DENV. RESULTS: The RAA primer pair F1/R2 was the optimal combination for detecting DENV. The RT-RAA was performed in an incubator block at 37°C for 20minutes, and the amplicons were visible in the flow dipsticks from a naked eye within 3minutes. The detection limit of the developed RT-RAA-LFD assay was 10 copies/μL with high specificity for DENV. Compared with commercial reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay, the kappa value of RT-RAA-LFD in the 247 clinical samples was 0.957. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a rapid and visual point-of-care test based on RT-RAA and LFD assay was developed. It was found to be suitable for reliable detection of DENV in low-resource settings with limited laboratory capabilities and optimal storage conditions. Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

27159058,2016 May,Using Rapid Diagnostic Tests as a Source of Viral RNA for Dengue Serotyping by RT-PCR - A Novel Epidemiological Tool.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus infection causes major public health problems in tropical and subtropical areas. In many endemic areas, including the Lao PDR, inadequate access to laboratory facilities is a major obstacle to surveillance and study of dengue epidemiology. Filter paper is widely used for blood collection for subsequent laboratory testing for antibody and nucleic acid detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that dengue viral RNA can be extracted from dengue rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and then submitted to real-time RT-PCR for serotyping. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the Standard Diagnostics (SD) Bioline Dengue Duo RDT, a commonly used test in dengue endemic areas. First, using the QIAamp RNA kit, dengue RNA was purified from the sample pad of the NS1 RDT loaded with virus isolates of the four serotypes, then quantified by RT-PCR. We observed greater recovery of virus, with a mean of 27 times more RNA recovered from RDT, than from filter paper. Second, we evaluated dengue NS1 RDTs from patients at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, (99 patients) and from rural Salavan Provincial Hospital (362 patients). There was good agreement between dengue RT-PCR from NS1 RDT with RT-PCR performed on RNA extracted from patient sera, either using RDT loaded with blood (82.8% and 91.4%, in Vientiane and Salavan, respectively) or serum (91.9% and 93.9%). There was 100% concordance between RDT and serum RT-PCR of infecting dengue serotype. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Therefore, the collection of NS1 positive RDTs, which do not require cold storage, may be a novel approach for dengue serotyping by RT-PCR and offers promising prospects for the collection of epidemiological data from previously inaccessible tropical areas to aid surveillance and public health interventions.

32365696,2020 Apr 29,Efficient Method for Molecular Characterization of the 5' and 3' Ends of the Dengue Virus Genome.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that is of major importance in public health. Although it has been extensively studied at the molecular level, sequencing of the 5' and 3' ends of the untranslated regions (UTR) commonly requires specific approaches for completion and corroboration. The present study aimed to characterize the 5' and 3' ends of dengue virus types 1 to 4. The 5' and 3' ends of twenty-nine dengue virus isolates from acute infections were amplified through a modified protocol of the rapid amplification cDNA ends approach. For the 5' end cDNA synthesis, specific anti-sense primers for each serotype were used, followed by polyadenylation of the cDNA using a terminal transferase and subsequent PCR amplification with oligo(dT) and internal specific reverse primer. At the 3' end of the positive-sense viral RNA, an adenine tail was directly synthetized using an Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase, allowing subsequent hybridization of the oligo(dT) during cDNA synthesis. The incorporation of the poly(A) tail at the 5' and 3' ends of the dengue virus cDNA and RNA, respectively, allowed for successful primer hybridization, PCR amplification and direct sequencing. This approach can be used for completing dengue virus genomes obtained through direct and next-generation sequencing methods. Pública, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá 111321, Colombia.

38140548,2023 Nov 24,Subgenomic Flaviviral RNAs of Dengue Viruses.,"Subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced during flavivirus infections in both arthropod and vertebrate cells. They are undegraded products originating from the viral 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), a result of the action of the host 5'-3' exoribonuclease, Xrn1, when it encounters specific RNA structures known as Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) within the viral 3' UTR. Dengue viruses generate three to four distinct species of sfRNAs through the presence of two xrRNAs and two dumbbell structures (DBs). The tertiary structures of xrRNAs have been characterized to form a ringlike structure around the 5' end of the viral RNA, effectively inhibiting the activity of Xrn1. The most important role of DENV sfRNAs is to inhibit host antiviral responses by interacting with viral and host proteins, thereby influencing viral pathogenicity, replicative fitness, epidemiological fitness, and transmission. In this review, we aimed to summarize the biogenesis, structures, and functions of DENV sfRNAs, exploring their implications for viral interference.

26593240,2015 Nov 23,Multiple Sources of Infection and Potential Endemic Characteristics of the Large Outbreak of Dengue in Guangdong in 2014.,"A large outbreak of dengue, with the most documented cases, occurred in Guangdong China in 2014. Epidemiological studies and phylogenetic analysis of the isolated dengue virus (DENV) showed this outbreak was attributed to multiple sources and caused by at least two genotypes of DENV-1 (Genotypes I and III) and two genotypes of DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan and Asian I Genotypes). A retrospective review and phylogenetic analysis of DENV isolated in Guangdong showed that DENV-1 Genotype I strains were reported continuously during 2004-2014, Genotype III strains were reported during 2009-2014 ; DENV-2 Cosmopolitan and Asian I Genotype strains were reported continuously during 2012-2014. At least 45,171 cases were reported in this outbreak, with 65.9% of the patients in the 21-55-year-old group. A trend toward a decrease in the daily newly emerged cases lagged by approximately 20 days compared with the mosquito density curve. Several epidemiological characteristics of this outbreak and the stably sustained serotypes and genotypes of DENV isolated in Guangdong suggest that Guangdong has been facing a threat of transforming from a dengue epidemic area to an endemic area. The high temperature, drenching rain, rapid urbanization, and pandemic of dengue in Southeast Asia may have contributed to this large outbreak of dengue.

20976219,2010 Oct 15,Wolbachia-mediated resistance to dengue virus infection and death at the cellular level.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is currently the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans. Recent work has shown dengue virus displays limited replication in its primary vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, when the insect harbors the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of virus replication may lead to novel methods of arboviral control, yet the functional and cellular mechanisms that underpin it are unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using paired Wolbachia-infected and uninfected Aedes-derived cell lines and dengue virus, we confirm the phenomenon of viral inhibition at the cellular level. Although Wolbachia imposes a fitness cost to cells via reduced proliferation, it also provides a significant degree of protection from virus-induced mortality. The extent of viral inhibition is related to the density of Wolbachia per cell, with highly infected cell lines showing almost complete protection from dengue infection and dramatically reduced virus titers compared to lines not infected with the bacteria. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that cells infected with Wolbachia display inhibition of dengue virus replication, that the extent of inhibition is related to bacterial density and that Wolbachia infection, although costly, will provide a fitness benefit in some circumstances. Our results parallel findings in mosquitoes and flies, indicating that cell line models will provide useful and experimentally tractable models to study the mechanisms underlying Wolbachia-mediated protection from viruses.","['Aedes/virology', 'Animals', '*Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dengue Virus/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Insect Vectors', 'Virus Replication', 'Wolbachia/cytology/*immunology/virology']","['BACKGROUND: Dengue is currently the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans.', 'Recent work has shown dengue virus displays limited replication in its primary vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, when the insect harbors the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis.', 'Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of virus replication may lead to novel methods of arboviral control, yet the functional and cellular mechanisms that underpin it are unknown.', 'METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using paired Wolbachia-infected and uninfected Aedes-derived cell lines and dengue virus', ', we confirm the phenomenon of viral inhibition at the cellular level.', 'Although Wolbachia imposes a fitness cost to cells via reduced proliferation, it also provides a significant degree of protection from virus-induced mortality.', 'The extent of viral inhibition is related to the density of Wolbachia per cell, with highly infected cell lines showing almost complete protection from dengue infection and dramatically reduced virus titers compared to lines not infected with the bacteria.', 'CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that cells infected with Wolbachia display inhibition of dengue virus replication, that the extent of inhibition is related to bacterial density and that Wolbachia infection, although costly, will provide a fitness benefit in some circumstances', '.', 'Our results parallel findings in mosquitoes and flies, indicating that cell line models will provide useful and experimentally tractable models to study the mechanisms underlying Wolbachia-mediated protection from viruses.']"
21228146,2011 Mar,Full serotype- and group-specific NS1 capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid differential diagnosis of dengue virus infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the Flavivirus family, has four distinct serotypes (DENV serotype 1 [DENV1], DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) that require differentiation for the effective prevention of morbid disease. Early and rapid differentiation between flaviviruses remains challenging. Full assays combining four individual, serotype-specific and one group-specific nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against DENV NS1 were developed and validated. The sensitivities and specificities of the full NS1 ELISAs were evaluated with viral cultures and dengue acute-phase sera. Four serotype-specific NS1 ELISAs displayed high specificities for the detection and differentiation of appropriate serotypes. The group-specific NS1 ELISA was broadly reactive with the four dengue virus serotypes. None of the NS1 ELISAs displayed cross-reactivity with the other flaviviruses or samples from febrile patients with non-dengue virus infections. The full serotype- and group-specific MAb-based NS1 capture ELISAs may provide tools for the early detection and typing of dengue infection, which is preferable to reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid differential diagnosis of dengue virus infection in the field.

30286095,2018 Oct,Inter- and intra-host sequence diversity reveal the emergence of viral variants during an overwintering epidemic caused by dengue virus serotype 2 in southern Taiwan.,"Purifying selection during dengue viral infection has been suggested as the driving force of viral evolution and the higher complexity of the intra-host quasi-species is thought to offer an adaptive advantage for arboviruses as they cycle between arthropod and vertebrate hosts. However, very few studies have been performed to investigate the viral genetic changes within (intra-host) and between (inter-host) humans in a spatio-temporal scale. Viruses of different serotypes from various countries imported to Taiwan cause annual outbreaks. During 2001-2003, two consecutive outbreaks were caused by dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and resulted in a larger-scale epidemic with more severe dengue cases in the following year. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the viruses from both events were similar and related to the 2001 DENV-2 isolate from the Philippines. We comprehensively analyzed viral sequences from representative dengue patients and identified three consensus genetic variants, group Ia, Ib and II, with different spatio-temporal population dynamics. The phylodynamic analysis suggested group Ib variants, characterized by lower genetic diversity, transmission rate, and intra-host variant numbers, might play the role of maintenance variants. The residential locations among the patients infected by group Ib variants were in the outer rim of case clusters throughout the 2001-2003 period whereas group Ia and II variants were located in the centers of case clusters, suggesting that group Ib viruses might serve as ""sheltered overwintering"" variants in an undefined ecological niche. Further deep sequencing of the viral envelope (E) gene directly from individual patient serum samples confirmed the emergence of variants belonging to three quasi-species (group Ia, Ib, and II) and the ancestral role of the viral variants in the latter phase of the 2001 outbreak contributed to the later, larger-scale epidemic beginning in 2002. These findings enhanced our understanding of increasing epidemic severity over time in the same epidemic area. It also highlights the importance of combining phylodynamic and deep sequencing analysis as surveillance tools for detecting dynamic changes in viral variants, particularly searching for and monitoring any specific viral subpopulation. Such subpopulations might have selection advantages in both fitness and transmissibility leading to increased epidemic severity. National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.

24865681,2014 Jul,Clinical presentation of dengue by serotype and year of epidemic in Martinique.,"During the last decade Martinique experienced four dengue epidemics, each characterized by the predominance of 1 or 2 serotypes. In this retrospective database analysis, we investigated the relationship between dengue serotype and disease severity. Data on dengue were collected from 715 patients (male/female ratio 0.87), 14 to 91 years of age (median 35 years) examined in the adult emergency department between 2005 and 2010. In this series, DENV-4 infections more frequently had a milder clinical presentation. The DENV-2 infections were most often secondary infections admitted at the critical phase of dengue illness with signs of plasma leakage. The DENV-1 infections were disabling, particularly in females, and most often led to disease of intermediate severity, without overt plasma leakage. These data were consistent with there being differences in virulence between serotypes, regardless of the host's immune status. However, secondary DENV-2 infections showed an increased risk of plasma leakage.

30808306,2019 Feb 26,Enrichment post-library preparation enhances the sensitivity of high-throughput sequencing-based detection and characterization of viruses from complex samples.,"BACKGROUND: Sequencing-based detection and characterization of viruses in complex samples can suffer from lack of sensitivity due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, low titer, small genome size, and contribution of host or environmental nucleic acids. Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost- and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.

32992973,2020 Sep 25,"Molecular Characterization of Dengue Type 2 Outbreak in Pacific Islands Countries and Territories, 2017-2020.","Dengue virus (DENV) serotype-2 was detected in the South Pacific region in 2014 for the first time in 15 years. In 2016-2020, DENV-2 re-emerged in French Polynesia, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia, co-circulating with and later replacing DENV-1. In this context, epidemiological and molecular evolution data are paramount to decipher the diffusion route of this DENV-2 in the South Pacific region. In the current work, the E gene from 23 DENV-2 serum samples collected in Vanuatu, Fiji, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia was sequenced. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed.

Both cell-based and biochemical assays, based on use of purified DENV full-length NS5 enzyme, were studied. Cytopathic effect protection and virus yield reduction assays confirmed that SOF possessed anti-DENV activity in cell culture with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 4.9 µM and 1.4 µM respectively. Real-time RT-PCR verified that SOF inhibits generation of viral RNA with an EC(50) of 9.9 µM. Purified DENV NS5 incorporated the active triphosphate form (SOF-TP) into nascent RNA, causing chain-termination. Relative to the natural UTP, the incorporation efficiency of SOF-TP was low (discrimination value = 327.5). In a primer extension assay, SOF-TP was active against DENV NS5 wild-type polymerase activity with an IC(50) of 14.7 ± 2.5 µM. The S600T substitution in the B Motif of DENV polymerase conferred 4.3-fold resistance to SOF-TP; this was due to decreased incorporation efficiency rather than enhanced excision of the incorporated SOF nucleotide. SOF has antiviral activity against DENV replication. The high discrimination value in favor of UTP in enzyme assays may not necessarily preclude antiviral activity in cells.

25644870,2015 May,Dengue virus NS4A cytoplasmic domain binding to liposomes is sensitive to membrane curvature.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a growing public health threat with more than one-third of the world's population at risk. Non-structural protein 4A (NS4A), one of the least characterized viral proteins, is a highly hydrophobic transmembrane protein thought to induce the membrane alterations that harbor the viral replication complex. The NS4A N-terminal (amino acids 1-48), has been proposed to contain an amphipathic α-helix (AH). Mutations (L6E; M10E) designed to reduce the amphipathic character of the predicted AH, abolished viral replication and reduced NS4A oligomerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (amino acids 1-48) of both wild type and mutant NS4A in the presence of SDS micelles. Binding of the two N-terminal NS4A peptides to liposomes was studied as a function of membrane curvature and lipid composition. The NS4A N-terminal was found to contain two AHs separated by a non-helical linker. The above mentioned mutations did not significantly affect the helical secondary structure of this domain. However, they reduced the affinity of the N-terminal NS4A domain for lipid membranes. Binding of wild type NS4A(1-48) to liposomes is highly dependent on membrane curvature.

25131332,2015 Jan,IFITM3-containing exosome as a novel mediator for anti-viral response in dengue virus infection.,"Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have recently been identified as potent antiviral effectors that function to suppress the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses and modulate cellular tropism independent of viral receptor expression. However, the antiviral effect and mechanisms of IFITMs in response to viral infections remain incompletely understood and characterized. In this work, we focused our investigation on the function of the extracellular IFITM3 protein. In cell models of DENV-2 infection, we found that IFITM3 contributed to both the baseline and interferon-induced inhibition of DENV entry. Most importantly, our study for the first time demonstrated the presence of IFITM-containing exosome in the extracellular environment, and identified an ability of cellular exosome to intercellularly deliver IFITM3 and thus transmit its antiviral effect from infected to non-infected cells. Thus, our findings provide new insights in the basic mechanisms underlying the actions of IFITM3, which might lead to future development of exosome-mediated anti-viral strategies using IFITM3 as a therapeutic agent. Conceivably, variations in the basal and inducible levels of IFITMs, as well as in intracellular and extracellular levels of IFITMs, might predict the severity of dengue virus infections among individuals or across species.

The viral replication was analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to monitor NS1 expression and by quantitative real-time PCR. WT D2 RNA-transfected cells were NS1- positive by day 5, whereas the chimeric RNA-transfected cells became NS1-positive ∼30 days post-transfection in three independent experiments. Sequence analysis covering the entire genome revealed the appearance of a single K74I mutation within the D4MT domain ∼16 days post-transfection in two experiments. In the third, D290N mutation in the conserved NS3 Walker B motif appeared ≥16 days post-transfection. A time course study of serial passages revealed that the 30-day supernatant had gradually evolved to gain replication fitness. Trans-complementation by co-expression of WT D2 NS5 accelerated viral replication of chimeric RNA without changing the K74I mutation. However, the MT and POL activities of NS5 WT D2 and the chimeric NS5 proteins with or without the K74I mutation are similar. Taken together, our results suggest that evolution of the functional interactions involving the chimeric NS5 protein encoded by the viral genome species is essential for gain of viral replication fitness. of Medicine, Washington, D.

32594967,2020 Jun 29,Dengue virus co-infections with multiple serotypes do not result in a different clinical outcome compared to mono-infections.,"Circulation of multiple dengue virus (DENV) serotypes in a locale has resulted in individuals becoming infected with mixed serotypes. This research was undertaken to study the clinical presentation, presence of DENV serotypes and serological characteristics of DENV infected patients with co-infections from three Provinces of Sri Lanka where DENV-1 and -2 predominated during the study. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on 1249 patient samples and 301 were positive for DENV (24.1%). DENV-1 was the predominant serotype detected in 137 (45.51%) followed by DENV-2 in 65 (21.59%), DENV-3 in 59 (19.6%) and DENV-4 in 4 (1.32%) patients with mono-infections. Thirty-three patients (10.96%) had DENV co-infections with two or more serotypes. The highest number of co-infections was noted between DENV-1 and DENV-2 (57.57%) suggesting co-infection is driven by the frequency of the circulating serotypes. Platelet counts were significantly higher in DENV co-infected patients although clinical disease severity or white blood cell count, packed cell volume or viraemia were not significantly different in the co-infected compared to the mono-infected patients. Thus co-infection with multiple DENV serotypes does occur but with the exception of improved platelet counts in co-infected patients, there is no evidence that clinical or laboratory measures of disease are altered.

19855901,2009 Nov,Dengue virus-induced regulation of the host cell translational machinery.,"Dengue virus (DV)-induced changes in the host cell protein synthesis machinery are not well understood. We investigated the transcriptional changes related to initiation of protein synthesis. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was infected with DV serotype 2 for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of one. RNA was extracted after 6, 24 and 48 h. Microarray results showed that 36.5% of the translation factors related to initiation of protein synthesis had significant differential expression (Z-score >or= +/-2.0). Confirmation was obtained by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Of the genes involved in the activation of mRNA for cap-dependent translation (eIF4 factors), eIF4A, eIF4G1 and eIF4B were up-regulated while the negative regulator of translation eIF4E-BP3 was down-regulated. This activation was transient since at 24 h post-infection levels were not significantly different from control cells. However, at 48 h post-infection, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G1, eIF4G3, eIF4B, and eIF4E-BP3 were down-regulated, suggesting that cap-dependent translation could be inhibited during the progression of infection. To test this hypothesis, phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, which induce cap-dependent protein synthesis, was assayed. Both proteins remained phosphorylated when assayed at 6 h after infection, while infection induced dephosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 at 24 and 48 h of infection, respectively. Taken together, these results provide biological evidence suggesting that in HepG2 cells DV sustains activation of the cap-dependent machinery at early stages of infection, but progression of infection switches protein synthesis to a cap-independent process.

33787737,2021,Epidemiological and genetic aspects of the largest dengue outbreak recorded in 2015 in Southeastern Brazil.,"Dengue virus, the etiological agent of dengue fever (DF) occurs in four genetically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4), being transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes. DF incidence is increasing in Brazil, following vector dispersal, proliferation and DENV serotypes introduction, co-circulation and substitution. Medium- and small-sized cities in Sao Paulo State, such as Marilia (Midwest region), have been affected by huge epidemics. To understand the evolution of DENV epidemics in medium-sized cities, in this study a historical data on DENV incidence (2000-2015) in Marilia, was evaluated. Previous studies disclosed regional and specific DF outcomes associated with 2007 outbreak in that city, when co-circulating DENV1 and DENV3 presented different hematological profiles. In this study, characteristics of 2007 DENV epidemics were compared to the epidemiological, hematological and demographic outlines of the major outbreak of DENV1 in Marilia in 2015. DENV1 genetic diversity was assessed through capsid and pre-membrane junction encoding gene (CprM) sequencing. The results revealed circulation of DENV1 serotype from 2007 to 2015, with epidemics occurring every three-years until 2013 and then, increasing yearly. There were significant differences in hematological profiles of DENV1 patients between 2015 and 2007. CprM showed DENV1 genetic variability in 2015, contrasting with the unique sequence pattern in 2007. These results reinforce the regional and temporal characteristics of DENV epidemics that need local public health research to improve care for people and to limit the spread of new serotypes/genotypes to uninfected areas. do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil. do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil. do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil. do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil.

23792329,2014 Jan,Dengue virus capsid protein interacts specifically with very low-density lipoproteins.,"Dengue affects millions of people worldwide. No specific treatment is currently available, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the viral components' interactions with host cellular structures. We tested dengue virus (DENV) capsid protein (C) interaction with low- and very low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL, respectively) using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, NMR and computational analysis. Data reveal a specific DENV C interaction with VLDL, but not LDL. This binding is potassium-dependent and involves the DENV C N-terminal region, as previously observed for the DENV C-lipid droplets (LDs) interaction. A successful inhibition of DENV C-VLDL binding was achieved with a peptide drug lead. The similarities between LDs and VLDL, and between perilipin 3 (DENV C target on LDs) and ApoE, indicate ApoE as the molecular target on VLDL. We hypothesize that DENV may form lipoviroparticles, which would constitute a novel step on DENV life cycle. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, NMR, and computational analysis, these authors demonstrate that dengue viral capsid proteins (DENV C) bind to very low density lipoprotein surfaces, but not to LDLs, in a potassium-dependent manner.

33154254,2020 Jul-Dec,"Molecular diversity of dengue virus serotypes 1-4 during an outbreak of acute dengue virus infection in Theni, India.","BACKGROUND: Dengue fever (DF) is caused by an arthropod-borne dengue virus (DENV), has four serotypes and several genotypes. Although having clinical and epidemiological significance, the information on the circulating serotypes/genotypes is scarce in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood specimens were collected from the patients suspected of DF and they are tested for DENV NS1 antigen and DENV IgM by ELISA. Antigen-positive samples were further serotyped by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Representative samples from each serotype were sequenced to identify the genotypes. RESULTS: All the four DENV serotypes were detected with the pre-dominance of DENV-1 (n = 49; 41.9%). Cases with multiple DENV serotype infections were also identified. Genotyping showed that DENV-1 belonging to genotype I, DENV-2 cosmopolitan (IV), DENV-3 genotype III and DENV-4 genotype I were active in the circulation during the outbreak in 2017. CONCLUSION: Our study documents the molecular characteristics of DENV circulating in our geographical locality. The detection of heterologous DENV serotypes highlights the importance of regular molecular monitoring for the early recognition of any switch in pre-dominant serotype. of Microbiology, Dr ALM PG IBMS, University of Madras, Chennai; Department of Microbiology, Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, Government Theni Medical College, Theni, Tamil Nadu, India. of Microbiology, Dr ALM PG IBMS, University of Madras, Chennai; Department of Microbiology, Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, Government Theni Medical College, Theni, Tamil Nadu, India.

21507975,2011 Jul,Inhibition of dengue virus through suppression of host pyrimidine biosynthesis.,"Viral replication relies on the host to supply nucleosides. Host enzymes involved in nucleoside biosynthesis are potential targets for antiviral development. Ribavirin (a known antiviral drug) is such an inhibitor that suppresses guanine biosynthesis; depletion of the intracellular GTP pool was shown to be the major mechanism to inhibit flavivirus. Along similar lines, inhibitors of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway could be targeted for potential antiviral development. Here we report on a novel antiviral compound (NITD-982) that inhibits host dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required for pyrimidine biosynthesis. The inhibitor was identified through screening 1.8 million compounds using a dengue virus (DENV) infection assay. The compound contains an isoxazole-pyrazole core structure, and it inhibited DENV with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 2.4 nM and a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) of >5 μM. NITD-982 has a broad antiviral spectrum, inhibiting both flaviviruses and nonflaviviruses with nanomolar EC(90)s. We also show that (i) the compound inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant DHODH, (ii) an NITD-982 analogue directly bound to the DHODH protein, (iii) supplementing the culture medium with uridine reversed the compound-mediated antiviral activity, and (iv) DENV type 2 (DENV-2) variants resistant to brequinar (a known DHODH inhibitor) were cross resistant to NITD-982. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the compound inhibits DENV through depleting the intracellular pyrimidine pool. In contrast to the in vitro potency, the compound did not show any efficacy in the DENV-AG129 mouse model. The lack of in vivo efficacy is likely due to the exogenous uptake of pyrimidine from the diet or to a high plasma protein-binding activity of the current compound.

21813150,2011 Sep 15,Induced autophagy reduces virus output in dengue infected monocytic cells.,"While several studies have shown a role for autophagy in the replication of dengue virus (DENV), these studies have been performed in directly infected cells. However, in severe cases of DENV infection the critical cell in the disease is believed to be monocytes which are poorly infected directly, but are highly susceptible to antibody enhanced infection. This study sought to determine the involvement of autophagy in the DENV infection of monocytic cells, using U937 cells as a model system. While the induction of autophagy was seen in response to DENV-2 infection, biochemical induction of autophagy resulted in a significant decrease in virus output. Down regulation of autophagy resulted in only a very slight increase in intracellular virus levels. In monocytic cells autophagy is not a significant part of the DENV replication mechanism, and there are distinct cell type specific differences in the DENV-autophagy interaction.

29200948,2017,Peptides as Therapeutic Agents for Dengue Virus.,"Dengue is an important global threat caused by dengue virus (DENV) that records an estimated 390 million infections annually. Despite the availability of CYD-TDV as a commercial vaccine, its long-term efficacy against all four dengue virus serotypes remains unsatisfactory. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of dengue. Peptide was once a neglected choice of medical treatment but it has lately regained interest from the pharmaceutical industry following pioneering advancements in technology. In this review, the design of peptide drugs, antiviral activities and mechanisms of peptides and peptidomimetics (modified peptides) action against dengue virus are discussed.

35215846,2022 Jan 27,Dengue and Zika Virus Capsid Proteins Contain a Common PEX19-Binding Motif.,"Flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to suppress the host immune system. For instance, flavivirus infections were found to sabotage peroxisomes, organelles with an important role in innate immunity. The current model suggests that the capsid (C) proteins of DENV and ZIKV downregulate peroxisomes, ultimately resulting in reduced production of interferons by interacting with the host protein PEX19, a crucial chaperone in peroxisomal biogenesis. Here, we aimed to explore the importance of peroxisomes and the role of C interaction with PEX19 in the flavivirus life cycle. By infecting cells lacking peroxisomes we show that this organelle is required for optimal DENV replication. Moreover, we demonstrate that DENV and ZIKV C bind PEX19 through a conserved PEX19-binding motif, which is also commonly found in cellular peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). However, in contrast to PMPs, this interaction does not result in the targeting of C to peroxisomes. Furthermore, we show that the presence of C results in peroxisome loss due to impaired peroxisomal biogenesis, which appears to occur by a PEX19-independent mechanism. Hence, these findings challenge the current model of how flavivirus C might downregulate peroxisomal abundance and suggest a yet unknown role of peroxisomes in flavivirus biology.

30011275,2018 Jul,Dengue infection in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue is the most extensively spread mosquito-borne disease; endemic in more than 100 countries. Information about dengue disease burden, its prevalence, incidence and geographic distribution is critical in planning appropriate control measures against dengue fever. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of dengue fever in India. METHODS: We searched for studies published until 2017 reporting the incidence, the prevalence or case fatality of dengue in India. Our primary outcomes were (a) prevalence of laboratory confirmed dengue infection among clinically suspected patients, (b) seroprevalence in the general population and (c) case fatality ratio among laboratory confirmed dengue patients. We used binomial-normal mixed effects regression model to estimate the pooled proportion of dengue infections. Forest plots were used to display pooled estimates. The metafor package of R software was used to conduct meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of the 2285 identified articles on dengue, we included 233 in the analysis wherein 180 reported prevalence of laboratory confirmed dengue infection, seven reported seroprevalence as evidenced by IgG or neutralizing antibodies against dengue and 77 reported case fatality. The overall estimate of the prevalence of laboratory confirmed dengue infection among clinically suspected patients was 38.3% (95% CI: 34.8%-41.8%). The pooled estimate of dengue seroprevalence in the general population and CFR among laboratory confirmed patients was 56.9% (95% CI: 37.5-74.4) and 2.6% (95% CI: 2-3.4) respectively. There was significant heterogeneity in reported outcomes (p-values<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Identified gaps in the understanding of dengue epidemiology in India emphasize the need to initiate community-based cohort studies representing different geographic regions to generate reliable estimates of age-specific incidence of dengue and studies to generate dengue seroprevalence data in the country.

21208923,2011 Feb 1,Heterotypic dengue infection with live attenuated monotypic dengue virus vaccines: implications for vaccination of populations in areas where dengue is endemic.,"BACKGROUND: Because infection with any of the 4 Dengue virus serotypes may elicit both protective neutralizing antibodies and nonneutralizing antibodies capable of enhancing subsequent heterotypic Dengue virus infections, the greatest risk for severe dengue occurs during a second, heterotypic Dengue virus infection. It remains unclear whether the replication of live attenuated vaccine viruses will be similarly enhanced when administered to Dengue-immune individuals. METHODS: We recruited 36 healthy adults who had previously received a monovalent live Dengue virus vaccine 0.6-7.4 years earlier. Participants were assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts and were randomly chosen to receive placebo or a heterotypic vaccine. The level of replication, safety, and immunogenicity of the heterotypic vaccine virus was compared with that of Dengue virus immunologically naive vaccinees. RESULTS: Vaccine virus replication and reactogenicity after monovalent Dengue virus vaccination in naive and heterotypically immune vaccinees was similar. In contrast to naive vaccinees, the antibody response in heterotypically immune vaccinees was broadly neutralizing and mimicked the response observed by natural secondary Dengue virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced replication of these live attenuated Dengue virus vaccines was minimal in heterotypically immune vaccinees and suggests that the further evaluation of these candidate vaccines in populations with preexisting DENV immunity can proceed safely.

30808916,2019 Feb 26,Mutations in the dimer interfaces of the dengue virus capsid protein affect structural stability and impair RNA-capsid interaction.,"The dengue virus 2 capsid protein (DENV2C) plays a primary structural role in the protection of the viral genome and is crucial for nucleocapsid assembly. In this study, we generated single mutants of DENV2C at L50 and L54 residues of the α2 helix, which was shown to interfere with the integration of the capsid into lipid droplets, and at residues L81 and I88 located in the α4 helix, which was shown to affect viral assembly. We demonstrated that the oligomeric states of DENV2C and its mutants exist primarily in the dimeric state in solution. All single-point mutations introduced in DENV2C promoted reduction in protein stability, an effect that was more pronounced for the L81N and I88N mutants, but not protein unfolding. All the single-point mutations affected the ability of DEN2C to interact with RNA. We concluded that mutations in the α2-α2' and α4-α4' dimer interfaces of DENV2C affect the structural stability of the protein and impair RNA-capsid interaction.

26871560,2016 Feb,Distribution of Dengue Virus Types 1 and 4 in Blood Components from Infected Blood Donors from Puerto Rico.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the four dengue viruses (DENV-1 to 4) that can also be transmitted by blood transfusion and organ transplantation. The distribution of DENV in the components of blood from infected donors is poorly understood. METHODS: We used an in-house TaqMan qRT-PCR assay to test residual samples of plasma, cellular components of whole blood (CCWB), serum and clot specimens from the same collection from blood donors who were DENV-RNA-reactive in a parallel blood safety study. To assess whether DENV RNA detected by TaqMan was associated with infectious virus, DENV infectivity in available samples was determined by culture in mosquito cells. RESULTS: DENV RNA was detected by TaqMan in all tested blood components, albeit more consistently in the cellular components; 78.8% of CCWB, 73.3% of clots, 86.7% of sera and 41.8% of plasma samples. DENV-1 was detected in 48 plasma and 97 CCWB samples while DENV-4 was detected in 21 plasma and 31 CCWB samples. In mosquito cell cultures, 29/111 (26.1%) plasma and 32/97 (32.7%) CCWB samples were infectious. A subset of samples from 29 donors was separately analyzed to compare DENV viral loads in the available blood components. DENV viral loads did not differ significantly between components and ranged from 3-8 log10 PCR-detectable units/ml. CONCLUSIONS: DENV was present in all tested components from most donors, and viral RNA was not preferentially distributed in any of the tested components. Infectious DENV was also present in similar proportions in cultured plasma, clot and CCWB samples, indicating that these components may serve as a resource when sample sizes are limited. However, these results suggest that the sensitivity of the nucleic acid tests (NAT) for these viruses would not be improved by testing whole blood or components other than plasma. America. America.

28748176,2017,Global Epidemiology of Dengue Outbreaks in 1990-2015: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Dengue is an arthropod-borne infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Approximately 50-100 million people are infected with DENV each year, resulting in a high economic burden on both governments and individuals. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize information regarding the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and serotype distribution and risk factors for global dengue outbreaks occurring from 1990 to 2015. We searched the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases through December 2016 using the term ""dengue outbreak."" In total, 3,853 studies were identified, of which 243 studies describing 262 dengue outbreaks met our inclusion criteria. The majority of outbreak-associated dengue cases were reported in the Western Pacific Region, particularly after the year 2010; these cases were primarily identified in China, Singapore and Malaysia. The pooled mean age of dengue-infected individuals was 30.1 years; of the included patients, 54.5% were male, 23.2% had DHF, 62.0% had secondary infections, and 1.3% died. The mean age of dengue patients reported after 2010 was older than that of patients reported before 2010 (34.0 vs. 27.2 years); however, the proportions of patients who had DHF, had secondary infections and died significantly decreased after 2010. Fever, malaise, headache, and asthenia were the most frequently reported clinical symptoms and signs among dengue patients. In addition, among the identified clinical symptoms and signs, positive tourniquet test (OR = 4.86), ascites (OR = 13.91) and shock (OR = 308.09) were identified as the best predictors of dengue infection, DHF and mortality, respectively (both P < 0.05). The main risk factors for dengue infection, DHF and mortality were living with uncovered water container (OR = 1.65), suffering from hypotension (OR = 6.18) and suffering from diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.53), respectively (all P < 0.05). The serotype distribution varied with time and across WHO regions. Overall, co-infections were reported in 47.7% of the evaluated outbreaks, and the highest pooled mortality rate (2.0%) was identified in DENV-2 dominated outbreaks. Our study emphasizes the necessity of implementing programs focused on targeted prevention, early identification, and effective treatment.

30686666,2019 Apr 2,Infectivity of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1 and 2 Is Correlated with E-Protein Intrinsic Dynamics but Not to Envelope Conformations.,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus with dire health and economic impacts. Dengue is responsible for an estimated 390 million infections per year, with dengue 2 (DENV2) being the most virulent strain among the four serotypes. Interestingly, it is also in strains of this serotype that temperature-dependent large-scale morphological changes, termed ""breathing,"" have been observed. Although the structure of these morphologies has been solved to 3.5-Å resolution, the dynamics of the viral envelope are unknown. Here, we combine fluorescence and mass spectrometry with molecular dynamics simulations to provide insights into DENV2 (NGC strain) structural dynamics in comparison with DENV1 (PVP 159). We observe hitherto unseen conformational changes and structural dynamics of the DENV2 envelope that are influenced by both temperature and divalent cations. Our results show that for DENV2 and DENV1 the intrinsic dynamics, but not the specific morphologies, are correlated with viral infectivity.

28934991,2017 Sep 22,"The dengue preface to endemic in mainland China: the historical largest outbreak by Aedes albopictus in Guangzhou, 2014.","BACKGROUND: Dengue was regarded as a mild epidemic in mainland China transmitted by Aedes albopictus. However, the 2014 record-breaking outbreak in Guangzhou could change the situation. In order to provide an early warning of epidemic trends and provide evidence for prevention and control strategies, we seek to characterize the 2014 outbreak through application of detailed cases and entomological data, as well as phylogenetic analysis of viral envelope (E) gene. METHODS: We used case survey data identified through the Notifiable Infectious Disease Report System, entomological surveillance and population serosurvey, along with laboratory testing for IgM/IgG, NS1, and isolation of viral samples followed by E gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to examine the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the outbreak. RESULTS: The 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangzhou accounted for nearly 80% of total reported cases that year in mainland China; a total of 37,376 cases including 37,340 indigenous cases with incidence rate 2908.3 per million and 36 imported cases were reported in Guangzhou, with 14,055 hospitalized and 5 deaths. The epidemic lasted for 193 days from June 11 to December 21, with the highest incidence observed in domestic workers, the unemployed and retirees. The inapparent infection rate was 18.00% (135/750). In total, 96 dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) and 11 dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) strains were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the DENV-1 strains were divided into genotype I and V, similar to the strains isolated in Guangzhou and Dongguan in 2013. The DENV-2 strains isolated were similar to those imported from Thailand on May 11 in 2014 and that imported from Indonesia in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: The 2014 dengue epidemic was confirmed to be the first co-circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 in Guangzhou. The DENV-1 strain was endemic, while the DENV-2 strain was imported, being efficiently transmitted by the Aedes albopictus vector species at levels as high as Aedes aegypti. Republic of China.

9201220,1997 Jun 23,A conserved internal hydrophobic domain mediates the stable membrane integration of the dengue virus capsid protein.,"The mature flavivirus capsid protein (virion C) is commonly thought to be free in the cytoplasm of infected cells and to form a nucleocapsid-like complex with genomic RNA in mature virus particles. There is little sequence conservation among flavivirus virion C proteins, but they are similar in size (e.g., 99 amino acids [aa] for the dengue-4 [DEN4] C) and in bearing a net positive charge. In addition, we noted that C contained a conserved internal hydrophobic segment (spanning aa 45-65 in the DEN4 C). Results of in vivo expression and in vitro translation of wt and mutant forms of the DEN4 virion C demonstrated that the conserved internal hydrophobic segment in the DEN C functioned as a membrane anchor domain. Signal peptide function of this segment was also suggested by its requirement for the entry of C into membranes. Virion C was integrated in membranes in a ""hairpin"" conformation; positively charged segments amino- and carboxy-terminal to the hydrophobic signal-anchor segment were accessible to protease digestion in the ""cytoplasm."" The net positive charge in the amino-terminal extramembraneous portion of C (aa 1-44) was one determinant of the hairpin membrane orientation; a conserved positively charged residue within the hydrophobic segment (Arg-54 in the DEN4 C) was not.

25102066,2014,Performance of Simplexa dengue molecular assay compared to conventional and SYBR green RT-PCR for detection of dengue infection in Indonesia.,"Diagnostic tests based on detection of dengue virus (DENV) genome are available with varying sensitivities and specificities. The Simplexa Dengue assay (Focus Diagnostics) is a newly developed real-time RT-PCR method designed to detect and serotype DENV simultaneously. To assess the performance of the Simplexa Dengue assay, we performed comparison with conventional RT-PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR on patients sera isolated from eight cities across Indonesia, a dengue endemic country. A total of 184 sera that were confirmed using NS1 and/or IgM and IgG ELISA were examined. Using conventional and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR, we detected DENV in 53 (28.8%) and 81 (44.0%) out of 184 sera, respectively. When the Simplexa Dengue assay was employed, the detection rate was increased to 76.6% (141 out of 184 samples). When tested in 40 sera that were confirmed by virus isolation as the gold standard, the conventional RT-PCR yielded 95% sensitivity while the sensitivity of SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR and Simplexa Dengue assay reached 97.5% and 100%, respectively. The specificities of all methods were 100% when tested in 43 non-dengue illness and 20 healthy human samples. Altogether, our data showed the higher detection rate of Simplexa Dengue compared to conventional and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR in field/surveillance setting. In conclusion, Simplexa Dengue offers rapid and accurate detection and typing of dengue infection and is suitable for both routine diagnostic and surveillance.

12890635,2003 Jul 20,A trade-off in replication in mosquito versus mammalian systems conferred by a point mutation in the NS4B protein of dengue virus type 4.,"An acceptable live-attenuated dengue virus vaccine candidate should have low potential for transmission by mosquitoes. We have identified and characterized a mutation in dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) that decreases the ability of the virus to infect mosquitoes. A panel of 1248 mutagenized virus clones generated previously by chemical mutagenesis was screened for decreased replication in mosquito C6/36 cells but efficient replication in simian Vero cells. One virus met these criteria and contained a single coding mutation: a C-to-U mutation at nucleotide 7129 resulting in a Pro-to-Leu change in amino acid 101 of the nonstructural 4B gene (NS4B P101L). This mutation results in decreased replication in C6/36 cells relative to wild-type DEN4, decreased infectivity for mosquitoes, enhanced replication in Vero and human HuH-7 cells, and enhanced replication in SCID mice implanted with HuH-7 cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice). A recombinant DEN4 virus (rDEN4) bearing this mutation exhibited the same set of phenotypes. Addition of the NS4B P101L mutation to rDEN4 bearing a 30 nucleotide deletion (Delta30) decreased the ability of the double-mutant virus to infect mosquitoes but increased its ability to replicate in SCID-HuH-7 mice. Although the NS4B P101L mutation decreases infectivity of DEN4 for mosquitoes, its ability to enhance replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice suggests that it might not be advantageous to include this specific mutation in an rDEN4 vaccine. The opposing effects of the NS4B P101L mutation in mosquito and vertebrate systems suggest that the NS4B protein is involved in maintaining the balance between efficient replication in the mosquito vector and the human host.

22031819,2011,Induction of a protective response in mice by the dengue virus NS3 protein using DNA vaccines.,"The dengue non-structural 3 (NS3) is a multifunctional protein, containing a serino-protease domain, located at the N-terminal portion, and helicase, NTPase and RTPase domains present in the C-terminal region. This protein is considered the main target for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses during dengue infection, which may be involved in protection. However, few studies have been undertaken evaluating the use of this protein as a protective antigen against dengue, as well as other flavivirus. In the present work, we investigate the protective efficacy of DNA vaccines based on the NS3 protein from DENV2. Different recombinant plasmids were constructed, encoding either the full-length NS3 protein or only its functional domains (protease and helicase), fused or not to a signal peptide (t-PA). The recombinant proteins were successfully expressed in transfected BHK-21 cells, and only plasmids encoding the t-PA signal sequence mediated protein secretion. Balb/c mice were immunized with the different DNA vaccines and challenged with a lethal dose of DENV2. Most animals immunized with plasmids encoding the full-length NS3 or the helicase domain survived challenge, regardless of the presence of the t-PA. However, some mice presented clinical signs of infection with high morbidity (hind leg paralysis and hunched posture), mainly in animal groups immunized with the DNA vaccines based on the helicase domain. On the other hand, inoculation with plasmids encoding the protease domain did not induce any protection, since mortality and morbidity rates in these mouse groups were similar to those detected in the control animals. The cellular immune response was analyzed by ELISPOT with a specific-CD8+ T cell NS3 peptide. Results revealed that the DNA vaccines based on the full-length protein induced the production of INF-γ, thus suggesting the involvement of this branch of the immune system in the protection.

24086778,2013,Factors associated with dengue shock syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of dengue shock syndrome (DSS, grade 3 and 4) is not yet completely understood. Several factors are reportedly associated with DSS, a more severe form of dengue infection that reportedly causes 50 times higher mortality compared to that of dengue patients without DSS. However, the results from these reports remain inconclusive. To better understand the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, and pathogenesis of DSS for development of new therapy, we systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies that reported factors in both DSS and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF, grade 1 and 2) patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Dengue Bulletin, Cochrane Library, Virtual Health Library, and a manual search of reference lists of articles published before September 2010 were used to retrieve relevant studies. A meta-analysis using fixed- or random-effects models was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) or event rate with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Assessment of heterogeneity and publication bias, meta-regression analysis, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and analysis of factor-specific relationships were further performed. There were 198 studies constituting 203 data sets that met our eligibility criteria. Our meta-regression analysis showed a sustained reduction of DSS/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) ratio over a period of 40 years in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand.

27556644,2016 Aug,Identification of RNA Binding Proteins Associated with Dengue Virus RNA in Infected Cells Reveals Temporally Distinct Host Factor Requirements.,"BACKGROUND: There are currently no vaccines or antivirals available for dengue virus infection, which can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and death. A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by cross-linking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells. This study significantly increases the number of cellular factors known to interact with DENV and reveals how DENV modulates and usurps cellular proteins for efficient amplification.

16251289,2005 Nov,"Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nonpegylated and pegylated forms of recombinant human alpha interferon 2a for suppression of dengue virus viremia in rhesus monkeys.","Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are caused by infection with any one of the four dengue viruses (DVs) and are significant public health burdens throughout the tropics. Higher viremia levels are associated with greater dengue disease severity. A therapeutic intervention to suppress viremia early in DV infection could potentially ameliorate severe disease. Recombinant alpha interferon 2a (rIFN-alpha-2a, Roferon-A) suppressed DV replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. We therefore examined the effects of rIFN-alpha-2a and pegylated recombinant IFN-alpha-2a (PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a, PEGASYS) on DV serotype 2 (DV-2) viremia in rhesus monkeys. Flavivirus-naïve monkeys were inoculated with DV-2 and randomized to receive a single dose of rIFN-alpha-2a (10 million international units/m2) versus placebo or PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a (6 microg/kg) versus placebo 1 day after the onset of viremia. Serial daily viremia levels were measured, and convalescent-phase DV-2 neutralizing antibody titers were determined. Compared to placebo, a single injection of rIFN-alpha-2a temporarily suppressed DV-2 replication and delayed the time to peak viremia by a median of 3 days. However, measures of total viral burden were not different between the two groups. A single injection of PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a significantly lowered daily viremia levels and improved virus clearance, starting 48 h after administration. There were no significant differences in DV-2 neutralizing antibody titers between the treatment and placebo groups at 30 and 90 days postinfection. Based on their individual effects, future studies should investigate a combination of rIFN-alpha-2a and PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a for suppression of dengue virus viremia and as a potential therapeutic intervention.

28187130,2017 Feb,"Detection of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses, West Nile, Dengue, Saint Louis Encephalitis, Ilheus, Bussuquara, and Yellow Fever in free-ranging black howlers (Alouatta caraya) of Northeastern Argentina.","Several medically important mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been detected in Argentina in recent years: Dengue (DENV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV), West Nile (WNV) and Yellow Fever (YFV) viruses. Evidence of Bussuquara virus (BSQV) and Ilheus virus (ILHV) activity were found, but they have not been associated with human disease. Non-human primates can act as important hosts in the natural cycle of flaviviruses and serological studies can lead to improved understanding of virus circulation dynamics and host susceptibility. From July-August 2010, we conducted serological and molecular surveys in free-ranging black howlers (Alouatta caraya) captured in northeastern Argentina. We used 90% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT90) to analyze 108 serum samples for antibodies to WNV, SLEV, YFV, DENV (serotypes 1and 3), ILHV, and BSQV. Virus genome detection was performed using generic reverse transcription (RT)-nested PCR to identify flaviviruses in 51 antibody-negative animals. Seventy animals had antibodies for one or more flaviviruses for a total antibody prevalence of 64.8% (70/108). Monotypic (13/70, 19%) and heterotypic (27/70, 39%) patterns were differentiated. Specific neutralizing antibodies against WNV, SLEV, DENV-1, DENV-3, ILHV, and BSQV were found. Unexpectedly, the highest flavivirus antibody prevalence detected was to WNV with 9 (8.33%) monotypic responses. All samples tested by (RT)-nested PCR were negative for viral genome. This is the first detection of WNV-specific antibodies in black howlers from Argentina and the first report in free-ranging non-human primates from Latin-American countries. Given that no animals had specific neutralizing antibodies to YFV, our results suggest that the study population remains susceptible to YFV.

25762732,2015 May,Dengue Virus Evolution under a Host-Targeted Antiviral.,"The host-targeted antiviral drug UV-4B reduces viral replication and promotes survival in a mouse model of experimental dengue virus (DENV) infection. UV-4B is an iminosugar that inhibits the α-glucosidase family of enzymes and subsequently the folding of glycosylated proteins, both viral and host. Here, we utilized next-generation sequencing to investigate evolution of a flavivirus under selective pressure by a host-targeted antiviral in vivo. In viral populations recovered from UV-4B-treated mice, there was a significant increase in the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs compared to findings in viral populations from vehicle-treated mice. The strongest evidence of positive selection was in the glycosylated membrane protein, thereby providing in vivo validation of the mechanism of action of an iminosugar. In addition, mutations in glycosylated proteins were present only in drug-treated mice after a single passage. However, the bulk of the other mutations were present in both populations, indicating nonspecific selective pressure. Together with the continued control of viremia by UV-4B, these findings are consistent with the previously predicted high genetic barrier to escape mutations in host-targeted antivirals. IMPORTANCE: Although hundreds of millions of people are infected with DENV every year, there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy. UV-4B has demonstrated antiviral activity against DENV and is expected to enter clinical trials soon. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of DENV resistance to UV-4B. Host-targeted antivirals are thought to have a higher genetic barrier to escape mutants than directly acting antivirals, yet there are very few published studies of viral evolution under host-targeted antivirals. No study to date has described flavivirus evolution in vivo under selective pressure by a host-based antiviral drug. We present the first in vivo study of the sequential progression of viral evolution under selective pressure by a host-targeted antiviral compound. This study bolsters support for the clinical development of UV-4B as an antiviral drug against DENV, and it provides a framework to compare how treatment with other host-targeted antiflaviviral drugs in humans and different animal models influence viral genetic diversity. sujan@lji.org.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Dengue/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imino Sugars/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']","['The host-targeted antiviral drug UV-4B reduces viral replication and promotes survival in a mouse model of experimental dengue virus (DENV) infection.', 'UV-4B is an iminosugar that inhibits the α-glucosidase family of enzymes and subsequently the folding of glycosylated proteins, both viral and host.', 'Here, we utilized next-generation sequencing to investigate evolution of a flavivirus under selective pressure by a host-targeted antiviral in vivo.', 'In viral populations recovered from UV-4B-treated mice, there was a significant increase in the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs compared to findings in viral populations from vehicle-treated mice.', 'The strongest evidence of positive selection was in the glycosylated membrane protein, thereby providing in vivo validation of the mechanism of action of an iminosugar.', 'In addition, mutations in glycosylated proteins were present only in drug-treated mice after a single passage.', 'However, the bulk of the other mutations were present in both populations, indicating nonspecific selective pressure.', 'Together with the continued control of viremia by UV-4B, these findings are consistent with the previously predicted high genetic barrier to escape mutations in host-targeted antivirals.', 'IMPORTANCE: Although hundreds of millions of people are infected with DENV every year, there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy.', 'UV-4B has demonstrated antiviral activity against DENV and is expected to enter clinical trials soon.', 'Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of DENV resistance to UV-4B.', 'Host-targeted antivirals are thought to have a higher genetic barrier to escape mutants than directly acting antivirals, yet there are very few published studies of viral evolution under host-targeted antivirals.', 'No study to date has described flavivirus evolution in vivo under selective pressure by a host-based antiviral drug.', 'We present the first in vivo study of the sequential progression of viral evolution under selective pressure by a host-targeted antiviral compound.', 'This study bolsters support for the clinical development of UV-4B as an antiviral drug against DENV, and it provides a framework to compare how treatment with other host-targeted antiflaviviral drugs in humans and different animal models influence viral genetic diversity.', 'sujan@lji.org', '.']"
22373153,2011,Structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening of novel methyltransferase inhibitors of the dengue virus.,"BACKGROUND: The dengue virus is the most significant arthropod-borne human pathogen, and an increasing number of cases have been reported over the last few decades. Currently neither vaccines nor drugs against the dengue virus are available. NS5 methyltransferase (MTase), which is located on the surface of the dengue virus and assists in viral attachment to the host cell, is a promising antiviral target. In order to search for novel inhibitors of NS5 MTase, we performed a computer-aided virtual screening of more than 5 million commercially available chemical compounds using two approaches: i) structure-based screening using the crystal structure of NS5 MTase and ii) ligand-based screening using active ligands of NS5 MTase. Structure-based screening was performed using the LIDAEUS (LIgand Discovery At Edinburgh UniverSity) program. The ligand-based screening was carried out using the EDULISS (EDinburgh University LIgand Selection System) program. RESULTS: The selection of potential inhibitors of dengue NS5 MTase was based on two criteria: the compounds must bind to NS5 MTase with a higher affinity than that of active NS5 MTase ligands, such as ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH); and the compounds must interact with residues that are catalytically important for the function of NS5 MTase. We found several compounds that bind strongly to the RNA cap site and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding site of NS5 MTase with better binding affinities than that of RTP and SAH. We analyzed the mode of binding for each compound to its binding site, and our results suggest that all compounds bind to their respective binding sites by interacting with, and thus blocking, residues that are vital for maintaining the catalytic activity of NS5 MTase. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered several potential compounds that are active against dengue virus NS5 MTase through virtual screening using structure-based and ligand-based methods. These compounds were predicted to bind into the SAM binding site and the RNA cap site with higher affinities than SAH and RTP. These compounds are commercially available and can be purchased for further biological activity tests.

25794961,2015 Aug 15,Impedimetric cell-based biosensor for real-time monitoring of cytopathic effects induced by dengue viruses.,"We describe an impedimetric cell-based biosensor constructed from poly-l-lysine (PLL)-modified screen-printed carbon electrode for real-time monitoring of dengue virus (DENV) infection of surface-immobilized baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) fibroblast cells. Cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by DENV-2 New Guinea C strain (including degenerative morphological changes, detachment, membrane degradation and death of host cells), were reflected by drastic decrease in impedance signal response detected as early as ~30 hours post-infection (hpi). In contrast, distinct CPE by conventional microscopy was evident only at ~72 hpi at the corresponding multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A parameter that describes the kinetics of cytopathogenesis, CIT50, which refers to the time taken for 50% reduction in impedance signal response, revealed an inverse linear relationship with virus titer and MOI. CIT50 values were also delayed by 31.5h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, based on the analysis of CIT50, the virus titer of a given sample can be determined from the measured impedance signal response. Furthermore, consistent impedance results were also obtained with clinical isolates of the four DENV serotypes verified by RT-PCR and cycle sequencing. This impedimetric cell-based biosensor represents a label-free and continuous approach for the dynamic measurement of cellular responses toward DENV infection, and for detecting the presence of infectious viral particles.

17360676,2007 Feb 27,c-Src protein kinase inhibitors block assembly and maturation of dengue virus.,"Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that represents an important emerging infectious disease and is an international health concern. Currently, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral therapy to prevent or to treat dengue virus infection. The slow progress in developing antiviral agents might be alleviated by the availability of efficient high-throughput anti-dengue virus screening assays. In this study, we report an immunofluorescence image-based assay suitable for identification of small molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection and replication. Using this assay, we have discovered that inhibitors of the c-Src protein kinase exhibit a potent inhibitory effect on dengue virus (serotypes 1-4) and murine flavivirus Modoc. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that the c-Src protein kinase inhibitor dasatinib prevents the assembly of dengue virions within the virus-induced membranous replication complex. These results demonstrate that this cell-based screen may provide a powerful means to identify new potential targets for anti-dengue drug development while simultaneously providing pharmacological probes to investigate dengue virus-host cell interactions at the biochemical level.

26458780,2016 Jan,Dengue in China: Comprehensive Phylogenetic Evaluation Reveals Evidence of Endemicity and Complex Genetic Diversity.,"Despite the increasing threat of dengue outbreaks in China, it is still considered as an imported disease and its introduction and/or circulation patterns remain obscure. On the basis of the most extensive phylogenetic analysis to date, we showed highly complex genetic diversity of dengue viruses (DENVs) in south China with up to 20 different clades/lineages from multiple serotypes co-circulating in the same year. Despite that most of these clades/lineages were resulted from imported cases, evidence of local persistence of DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) was observed, indicating its potential endemicity in Guangdong province.

14963133,2004 Mar,Alterations of pr-M cleavage and virus export in pr-M junction chimeric dengue viruses.,"During the export of flavivirus particles through the secretory pathway, a viral envelope glycoprotein, prM, is cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin; this cleavage is required for the subsequent rearrangement of receptor-binding E glycoprotein and for virus infectivity. Similar to many furin substrates, prM in vector-borne flaviviruses contains basic residues at positions P1, P2, and P4 proximal to the cleavage site; in addition, a number of charged residues are found at position P3 and between positions P5 and P13 that are conserved for each flavivirus antigenic complex. The influence of additional charged residues on pr-M cleavage and virus replication was investigated by replacing the 13-amino-acid, cleavage-proximal region of a dengue virus (strain 16681) with those of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and by comparing the resultant chimeric viruses generated from RNA-transfected mosquito cells. Among the three chimeric viruses, cleavage of prM was enhanced to a larger extent in JEVpr/16681 than in YFVpr/16681 but was slightly reduced in TBEVpr/16681. Unexpectedly, JEVpr/16681 exhibited decreased focus size, reduced peak titer, and depressed replication in C6/36, PS, and Vero cell lines. The reduction of JEVpr/16681 multiplication correlated with delayed export of infectious virions out of infected cells but not with changes in specific infectivity. Binding of JEVpr/16681 to immobilized heparin and the heparin-inhibitable infection of cells were not altered. Thus, diverse pr-M junction-proximal sequences of flaviviruses differentially influence pr-M cleavage when tested in a dengue virus prM background. More importantly, greatly enhanced prM cleavability adversely affects dengue virus export while exerting a minimal effect on infectivity. Because extensive changes of charged residues at the pr-M junction, as in JEVpr/16681, were not observed among a large number of dengue virus isolates, these results provide a possible mechanism by which the sequence conservation of the pr-M junction of dengue virus is maintained in nature.

28068335,2017 Jan,Dengue in Latin America: Systematic Review of Molecular Epidemiological Trends.,"Dengue, the predominant arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, is caused by one of four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3 or -4). A literature analysis and review was undertaken to describe the molecular epidemiological trends in dengue disease and the knowledge generated in specific molecular topics in Latin America, including the Caribbean islands, from 2000 to 2013 in the context of regional trends in order to identify gaps in molecular epidemiological knowledge and future research needs. Searches of literature published between 1 January 2000 and 30 November 2013 were conducted using specific search strategies for each electronic database that was reviewed. A total of 396 relevant citations were identified, 57 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All four dengue virus serotypes were present and co-circulated in many countries over the review period (with the predominance of individual serotypes varying by country and year). The number of countries in which more than one serotype circulated steadily increased during the period under review. Molecular epidemiology data were found for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, the Caribbean region, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Central America, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Distinct lineages with different dynamics were found in each country, with co-existence, extinction and replacement of lineages occurring over the review period. Despite some gaps in the literature limiting the possibility for comparison, our review has described the molecular epidemiological trends of dengue infection. However, several gaps in molecular epidemiological information across Latin America and the Caribbean were identified that provide avenues for future research; in particular, sequence determination of the dengue virus genome is important for more precise phylogenetic classification and correlation with clinical outcome and disease severity.

Thailand is one of the countries where people are susceptible to infection due to favourable geographical and environmental conditions. In this retrospective study, we reported the changing pattern of dengue virus serotypes during the period between 2004 and 2010. The following percentage prevalence showed different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) predominant in respective years: DENV1 in 2004 (56.41%), DENV4 in 2007 (50%), DENV1 in 2008 (57.41%), and DENV3 in 2010 (38.7%). Moreover, the major serotypes were not stable as they showed a shift from one serotype to another. We also found co-infection with two different serotypes and reported the clinical manifestations, which were not different from infection with a single serotype.

The analysis showed RT-PCR to be the most sensitive and specific (100%) diagnostic method during the first 3 days of fever. The overall sensitivity of dengue NS1 antigen assays within the same period was 81.7%, indicating their potential role as a cost-effective and convenient alternative method to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of dengue fever in a primary healthcare setting.

26905233,2015 Dec,Re-emergence of dengue virus serotype 2 strains in the 2013 outbreak in Nepal.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological interventions and mosquito control are the available measures for dengue control. The former approach uses serotype and genetic information on the circulating virus strains. Dengue has been frequently reported from Nepal, but this information is mostly lacking. The present study was done to generate a comprehensive clinical and virological picture of a dengue outbreak in Nepal during 2013. METHODS: A hospital-based study involving patients from five districts of Nepal was carried out. Demographic information, clinical details and dengue serological status were obtained. Viral RNA was characterized at the molecular level by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: From among the 2340 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases during the study period, 198 patients consented for the study. Clinically they had fever (100%), headache (59.1%), rashes (18.2%), retro-orbital pain (30.3%), vomiting (15.1%), joint pain (28.8%) and thrombocytopenia (74.3%). Fifteen (7.5%) of them had mucosal bleeding manifestations, and the rest were uncomplicated dengue fever. The patients were mostly adults with a mean age of 45.75 ± 38.61 yr. Of the 52 acute serum samples tested, 15 were positive in RT-PCR. The causative virus was identified as DENV serotype 2 belonging to the Cosmopolitan genotype. INTERPRETATIONS & CONCLUSIONS: We report here the involvement of DENV serotype 2 in an outbreak in Nepal in 2013. Earlier outbreaks in the region in 2010 were attributed to serotype 1 virus. As serotype shifts are frequently associated with secondary infections and severe disease, there is a need for enhancing surveillance especially in the monsoon and post-monsoon periods to prevent large-scale, severe dengue outbreaks in the region.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/blood/*epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mosquito Control', 'Nepal', '*Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Seasons', 'Serogroup']","['BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological interventions and mosquito control are the available measures for dengue control.', 'The former approach uses serotype and genetic information on the circulating virus strains.', 'Dengue has been frequently reported from Nepal, but this information is mostly lacking.', 'The present study was done to generate a comprehensive clinical and virological picture of a dengue outbreak in Nepal during 2013.', 'METHODS: A hospital-based study involving patients from five districts of Nepal was carried out.', 'Demographic information, clinical details and dengue serological status were obtained.', 'Viral RNA was characterized at the molecular level by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.', 'RESULTS: From among the 2340 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases during the study period, 198 patients consented for the study.', 'Clinically they had fever (100%), headache (59.1%), rashes (18.2%), retro-orbital pain (30.3%), vomiting (15.1%), joint pain (28.8%) and thrombocytopenia (74.3%).', 'Fifteen (7.5%) of them had mucosal bleeding manifestations, and the rest were uncomplicated dengue fever.', 'The patients were mostly adults with a mean age of 45.75 ± 38.61 yr.', 'Of the 52 acute serum samples tested, 15 were positive in RT-PCR.', 'The causative virus was identified as DENV serotype 2 belonging to the Cosmopolitan genotype.', 'INTERPRETATIONS & CONCLUSIONS: We report here the involvement of DENV serotype 2 in an outbreak in Nepal in 2013.', 'Earlier outbreaks in the region in 2010 were attributed to serotype 1 virus.', 'As serotype shifts are frequently associated with secondary infections and severe disease, there is a need for enhancing surveillance especially in the monsoon and post-monsoon periods to prevent large-scale, severe dengue outbreaks in the region.']"
21613462,2011 Jul,Dengue virus immunoglobulin M detection in a reference laboratory setting during the 2010 dengue virus outbreak on Caribbean islands.,"A large outbreak of dengue virus (DV) infections occurred on Caribbean islands during 2010, with cases peaking during the second half of the year. In conjunction with the outbreak, we observed an unprecedented spike in the number of sera submitted for DV antibody testing between June and December 2010, with a concomitant increase in the number of IgM-positive specimens, indicative of acute DV infection. Analysis of the place of residence of the IgM-positive patients identified from June to December of 2010 revealed that 58.1% were residents of Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), whereas 40.6% were residents of the U.S. mainland or Hawaii. The U.S. residents represented 42 states plus the District of Columbia, but most (53%) were from just 3 states (California, Florida, and New York). In comparison to the Caribbean IgM-positive patient group, the U.S. IgM-positive patient group contained proportionately more adults 21 to 60 years old and fewer individuals <21 years old.

METHODS: In this study, focusing on early recruitment, we performed whole-blood transcriptional profiling on dengue virus PCR positive patients sampled within 72 h of self-reported fever presentation (average 43 h, SD 18.6 h) and compared the signatures with autologous samples drawn at defervescence and convalescence and to control patients with fever of other etiology. RESULTS: In the early dengue fever phase, a strong activation of the innate immune response related genes were seen that was absent at defervescence (4-7 days after fever debut), while at this second sampling genes related to biosynthesis and metabolism dominated. Transcripts relating to the adaptive immune response were over-expressed in the second sampling point with sustained activation at the third sampling. On an individual gene level, significant enrichment of transcripts early in dengue disease were chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL8 (MCP-2), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL3 (MIP-1α), antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 1 (DEFB1), desmosome/intermediate junction component plakoglobin (JUP) and a microRNA which may negatively regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines in dengue infected peripheral blood cells, mIR-147 (NMES1). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the early response in patients mimics those previously described in vitro, where early assessment of transcriptional responses has been easily obtained. Several of the early transcripts identified may be affected by or mediate the pathogenesis and deserve further assessment at this timepoint in correlation to severe disease. thomas.tolfvenstam@ki.se","['Adaptive Immunity', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Dengue/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']","['BACKGROUND: While dengue-elicited early and transient host responses preceding defervescence could shape the disease outcome and reveal mechanisms of the disease pathogenesis, assessment of these responses are difficult as patients rarely seek healthcare during the first days of benign fever and thus data are lacking.', 'METHODS: In this study, focusing on early recruitment, we performed whole-blood transcriptional profiling on dengue virus PCR positive patients sampled within 72 h of self-reported fever presentation (average 43 h, SD 18.6 h) and compared the signatures with autologous samples drawn at defervescence and convalescence and to control patients with fever of other etiology.', 'RESULTS: In the early dengue fever phase, a strong activation of the innate immune response related genes were seen that was absent at defervescence (4-7 days after fever debut), while at this second sampling genes related to biosynthesis and metabolism dominated.', 'Transcripts relating to the adaptive immune response were over-expressed in the second sampling point with sustained activation at the third sampling.', 'On an individual gene level, significant enrichment of transcripts early in dengue disease were chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL8 (MCP-2), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL3 (MIP-1α), antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 1 (DEFB1), desmosome/intermediate junction component plakoglobin (JUP) and a microRNA which may negatively regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines in dengue infected peripheral blood cells, mIR-147 (NMES1).', 'CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the early response in patients mimics those previously described in vitro, where early assessment of transcriptional responses has been easily obtained.', 'Several of the early transcripts identified may be affected by or mediate the pathogenesis and deserve further assessment at this timepoint in correlation to severe disease.', 'thomas.tolfvenstam@ki.se']"
18570970,2008 Aug 1,Expression profile of interferon stimulated genes in central nervous system of mice infected with dengue virus Type-1.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause a self-limiting disease (dengue fever) or a more severe clinical presentation known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Furthermore, data from recent dengue epidemics in Brazil indicate that the neurological manifestations are becoming more prevalent. However, the neuropathogenesis of dengue are not well understood. The balance between viral replication efficiency and innate immunity--in opposition during the early stages of infection--determines the clinical outcome of DENV infection. In this study, we investigated the effects of DENV infection on the transcription profile of the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. We observed in infected mice the up-regulation of 151 genes possibly involved in neuropathogenesis of dengue. Conversely, they may have a protective effect.

30830907,2019 Mar,Virulence difference of five type I dengue viruses and the intrinsic molecular mechanism.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important vector-borne virus globally. The safe and effective vaccines are still under development and there are no antiviral drugs for DENV induced diseases. In this study, we obtained five DENV1 isolates (DENV1 A to E) from the outbreak of dengue fever in 2014 of Guangzhou, China, and analyzed their replication efficiency and virulence in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that among the five DENV1 strains, DENV1 B has the highest replication efficiency in both human and mosquito cells in vitro, also causes the highest mortality to suckling mice. Further study suggested that nonstructural proteins from DENV1B have higher capacity to suppress host interferon signaling. In addition, the NS2B3 protease from DENV1B has higher enzymatic activity compared with that from DENV1 E. Finally, we identified that the 64th amino acid of NS2A and the 55th amino acid of NS2B were two virulence determining sites for DENV1.

25064368,2014 Jul 26,The changing incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in Indonesia: a 45-year registry-based analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Increases in human population size, dengue vector-density and human mobility cause rapid spread of dengue virus in Indonesia. We investigated the changes in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence in Indonesia over a 45-year period and determined age-specific trends in annual DHF incidence. METHODS: Using an on-going nationwide dengue surveillance program starting in 1968, we evaluated all DHF cases and related deaths longitudinally up to 2013. Population demographics were used to calculate annual incidence and case fatality ratios (CFRs). Age-specific data on DHF available from 1993 onwards were used to assess trends in DHF age-distribution. Time-dependency of DHF incidence and CFRs was assessed using the Cochrane-Armitage trend test. RESULTS: The annual DHF incidence increased from 0.05/100,000 in 1968 to ~ 35-40/100,000 in 2013, with superimposed epidemics demonstrating a similar increasing trend with the highest epidemic occurring in 2010 (85.70/100,000; p < 0.01). The CFR declined from 41% in 1968 to 0.73% in 2013 (p < 0.01). Mean age of DHF cases increased during the observation period. Highest incidence of DHF was observed among children aged 5 to 14 years up to 1998, but declined thereafter (p < 0.01). In those aged 15 years or over, DHF incidence increased (p < 0.01) and surpassed that of 5 to 14 year olds from 1999 onwards. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of DHF over the past 45 years in Indonesia increased rapidly with peak incidence shifting from young children to older age groups. The shifting age pattern should have consequences for targeted surveillance and prevention.

16306584,2005 Dec,Clade replacements in dengue virus serotypes 1 and 3 are associated with changing serotype prevalence.,"The evolution of dengue virus (DENV) is characterized by phylogenetic trees that have a strong temporal structure punctuated by dramatic changes in clade frequency. To determine the cause of these large-scale phylogenetic patterns, we examined the evolutionary history of DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) and DENV-3 in Thailand, where gene sequence and epidemiological data are relatively abundant over a 30-year period. We found evidence for the turnover of viral clades in both serotypes, most notably in DENV-1, where a major clade replacement event took place in genotype I during the mid-1990s. Further, when this clade replacement event was placed in the context of changes in serotype prevalence in Thailand, a striking pattern emerged; an increase in DENV-1 clade diversity was associated with an increase in the abundance of this serotype and a concomitant decrease in DENV-4 prevalence, while clade replacement was associated with a decline in DENV-1 prevalence and a rise of DENV-4. We postulate that intraserotypic genetic diversification proceeds at times of relative serotype abundance and that replacement events can result from differential susceptibility to cross-reactive immune responses.

30103543,2018 Aug 12,Salivary Detection of Dengue Virus NS1 Protein with a Label-Free Immunosensor for Early Dengue Diagnosis.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a highly pathogenic, arthropod-borne virus transmitted between people by Aedes mosquitoes. Despite efforts to prevent global spread, the potential for DENV epidemics is increasing world-wide. Annually, 3.6 billion people are at risk of infection. With no licensed vaccine, early diagnosis of dengue infection is critical for clinical management and patient survival. Detection of DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a clinically accepted biomarker for the early detection of DENV infection. Unfortunately, virtually all of the laboratory and commercial DENV NS1 diagnostic methods require a blood draw for sample analysis, limiting point-of-care diagnostics and decreases patient willingness. Alternatively, NS1 in human saliva has been identified for the potential early diagnosis of DENV infection. The collection of saliva is simple, non-invasive, painless, and inexpensive, even by minimally trained personnel. In this study, we present a label-free chemiresistive immunosensor for the detection of the DENV NS1 protein utilizing a network of single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with anti-dengue NS1 monoclonal antibodies. NS1 was successfully detected in adulterated artificial human saliva over the range of clinically relevant concentrations with high sensitivity and selectivity.

It is unknown how anti-prM antibody-coated particles can undergo membrane fusion since the prM caps the envelope (E) protein fusion loop. Here, we determined cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of the immDENV:anti-prM complex at different pH values, mimicking the extracellular (pH 8.0) or endosomal (pH 5.0) environments. At pH 5.0, there are two structural classes with fewer antibodies bound than at pH 8.0. These classes may represent different maturation states. Molecular simulations, together with the measured high-affinity pr:antibody interaction (versus the weak pr:E interaction) and also the low pH cryo-EM structures, suggest how antibody:pr complex can dislodge from the E protein at low pH. This exposes the E protein fusion loop enhancing virus interaction with endosomes. 169857, Singapore; Centre for BioImaging Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117557, Singapore. 169857, Singapore; Centre for BioImaging Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117557, Singapore.

21658241,2011 Jun 9,Structural mutants of dengue virus 2 transmembrane domains exhibit host-range phenotype.,"BACKGROUND: There are over 700 known arboviruses and at least 80 immunologically distinct types that cause disease in humans. Arboviruses are transmitted among vertebrates by biting insects, chiefly mosquitoes and ticks. These viruses are widely distributed throughout the world, depending on the presence of appropriate hosts (birds, horses, domestic animals, humans) and vectors. Mosquito-borne arboviruses present some of the most important examples of emerging and resurgent diseases of global significance. METHODS: A strategy has been developed by which host-range mutants of Dengue virus can be constructed by generating deletions in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the E glycoprotein. The host-range mutants produced and selected favored growth in the insect hosts. Mouse trials were conducted to determine if these mutants could initiate an immune response in an in vivo system. RESULTS: The DV2 E protein TMD defined as amino acids 452SWTMKILIGVIITWIG467 was found to contain specific residues which were required for the production of this host-range phenotype. Deletion mutants were found to be stable in vitro for 4 sequential passages in both host cell lines. The host-range mutants elicited neutralizing antibody above that seen for wild-type virus in mice and warrant further testing in primates as potential vaccine candidates. CONCLUSIONS: Novel host-range mutants of DV2 were created that have preferential growth in insect cells and impaired infectivity in mammalian cells. This method for creating live, attenuated viral mutants that generate safe and effective immunity may be applied to many other insect-borne viral diseases for which no current effective therapies exist.","['Aedes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cell Line', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', '*Host Specificity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism']","['BACKGROUND: There are over 700 known arboviruses and at least 80 immunologically distinct types that cause disease in humans.', 'Arboviruses are transmitted among vertebrates by biting insects, chiefly mosquitoes and ticks.', 'These viruses are widely distributed throughout the world, depending on the presence of appropriate hosts (birds, horses, domestic animals, humans) and vectors.', 'Mosquito-borne arboviruses present some of the most important examples of emerging and resurgent diseases of global significance.', 'METHODS: A strategy has been developed by which host-range mutants of Dengue virus can be constructed by generating deletions in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the E glycoprotein.', 'The host-range mutants produced and selected favored growth in the insect hosts.', 'Mouse trials were conducted to determine if these mutants could initiate an immune response in an in vivo system.', 'RESULTS: The DV2 E protein TMD defined as amino acids 452SWTMKILIGVIITWIG467 was found to contain specific residues which were required for the production of this host-range phenotype.', 'Deletion mutants were found to be stable in vitro for 4 sequential passages in both host cell lines.', 'The host-range mutants elicited neutralizing antibody above that seen for wild-type virus in mice and warrant further testing in primates as potential vaccine candidates.', 'CONCLUSIONS: Novel host-range mutants of DV2 were created that have preferential growth in insect cells and impaired infectivity in mammalian cells.', 'This method for creating live, attenuated viral mutants that generate safe and effective immunity may be applied to many other insect-borne viral diseases for which no current effective therapies exist.']"
32265181,2020 Dec,"Dengue hemorrhagic fever - A systemic literature review of current perspectives on pathogenesis, prevention and control.","BACKGROUND: Dengue is an arboviral disease caused by dengue virus. Symptomatic dengue infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild dengue fever (DF) to potentially fatal disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). We conducted a literature review to analyze the risks of DHF and current perspectives for DHF prevention and control. METHODS: According to the PRISMA guidelines, the references were selected from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar database using search strings containing a combination of terms that included dengue hemorrhagic fever, pathogenesis, prevention and control. Quality of references were evaluated by independent reviewers. RESULTS: DHF was first reported in the Philippines in 1953 and further transmitted to the countries in the region of South-East Asia and Western Pacific. Plasma leakages is the main pathophysiological hallmark that distinguishes DHF from DF. Severe plasma leakage can result in hypovolemic shock. Various factors are thought to impact disease presentation and severity. Virus virulence, preexisting dengue antibodies, immune dysregulation, lipid change and host genetic susceptibility are factors reported to be correlated with the development of DHF. However, the exact reasons and mechanisms that triggers DHF remains controversial. Currently, no specific drugs and licensed vaccines are available to treat dengue disease in any of its clinical presentations. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that antibody-dependent enhancement, cytokine dysregulation and variation of lipid profiles are correlated with DHF occurrence. Prompt diagnosis, appropriate treatment, active and continuous surveillance of cases and vectors are the essential determinants for dengue prevention and control.

26984144,2016 Oct 1,Homotypic Dengue Virus Reinfections in Nicaraguan Children.,"BACKGROUND: Infection with any of the 4 related dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-4) is thought to result in lifelong immunity to homotypic reinfection (ie, reinfection with the same serotype). METHODS: Archived serum samples collected as part of an ongoing pediatric dengue cohort study in Nicaragua were tested for DENV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Samples were collected from 2892 children who presented with an acute febrile illness clinically attributed to a non-DENV cause (hereafter, ""C cases""). Test results were added to a database of previously identified symptomatic dengue cases in the cohort to identify repeat infections. RESULTS: Four patients with homotypic DENV reinfections were identified and confirmed among 29 repeat DENV infections (13.8%) with serotype confirmation. Homotypic reinfections with DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 occurred 325-621 days after the initial infection. Each patient experienced 1 symptomatic dengue case and 1 DENV-positive C case, and 2 patients presented with symptomatic dengue during their second infection. These DENV-positive C cases did not elicit long-lived humoral immune responses, despite viremia levels of up to 6.44 log10 copies per mL of serum. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first set of virologically confirmed homotypic DENV reinfections. Such cases challenge the current understanding of DENV immunity and have important implications for modeling DENV transmission. Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

32898584,2020 Nov,A dengue type 2 reporter virus assay amenable to high-throughput screening.,"Dengue virus (DV) is an important mosquito-borne flavivirus threatening almost half of the world's population. Prophylaxis and potent anti-DV drugs are urgently needed. Here, we developed a high content imaging-based (HCI) assay with DV type 2 expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry (DV2/mCherry) to improve the efficiency and robustness of the drug discovery process. For the construction of the reporter virus, the mCherry gene followed by the ribosome-skipping 2A sequence of the Thosea asigna virus (T2A) was placed upstream of the full DV2 open reading frame. The biological characteristics including mCherry expression, virus replication rate, and plaque phenotype was examined and validated in BHK-21, Vero and C6/36 cells. A robust image-based antiviral assay combined with an automated robotic system was then developed, with a Z' factor of 0.73. To validate the image-based antiviral assay, a panel of reference compounds with different molecular mechanisms of anti-DV activity was assessed: (i) the glycosylation inhibitor, Celgosivir, (ii) two NS4b-targeting compounds: a 3-Acyl-indole derivative and NITD618, and (iii) two nucleoside viral polymerase inhibitors, 2'CMC and 7DMA. The inhibition profiles were quantified and obtained by means of HCI and RT-qPCR. Both methods resulted in very comparable inhibition profiles. In conclusion, a powerful and robust assay was developed with a fully automated data generation and processing pipeline. It makes the new reporter virus assay amenable to high-throughput screening of large libraries of small molecules.

23227238,2012,Screening of Dengue virus antiviral activity of marine seaweeds by an in situ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Dengue is a significant public health problem worldwide. Despite the important social and clinical impact, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for prevention and treatment of dengue virus (DENV) infection.

In this study we propose a target-free approach for dengue drug discovery based on a novel, rapid, and economic in situ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the screening of a panel of marine seaweed extracts. The in situ ELISA was standardized and validated for Huh7.5 cell line infected with all four serotypes of DENV, among them clinical isolates and a laboratory strain. Statistical analysis showed an average S/B of 7.2 and Z-factor of 0.62, demonstrating assay consistency and reliability.

18801552,2008 Nov 10,Temperature-dependent production of pseudoinfectious dengue reporter virus particles by complementation.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for 50 to 100 million human infections each year, highlighting the need for a safe and effective vaccine. In this study, we describe the production of pseudoinfectious DENV reporter virus particles (RVPs) using two different genetic complementation approaches, including the creation of cell lines that release reporter viruses in an inducible fashion. In contrast to studies with West Nile virus (WNV), production of infectious DENV RVPs was temperature-dependent; the yield of infectious DENV RVPs at 37 degrees C is significantly reduced in comparison to experiments conducted at lower temperatures or with WNV. This reflects both a significant reduction in the rate of infectious DENV RVP release over time, and the more rapid decay of infectious DENV RVPs at 37 degrees C.

23009809,2013 Jan,Stereochemical features of the envelope protein Domain III of dengue virus reveals putative antigenic site in the five-fold symmetry axis.,"We bring to attention a characteristic parasitic pattern present in the dengue virus: it undergoes several intensive thermodynamic variations due to host environmental changes, from a vector's digestive tract, through the human bloodstream and intracellular medium. Comparatively, among the known dengue serotypes, we evaluate the effects that these medium variations may induce to the overall structural characteristics of the Domain III of the envelope (E) protein, checking for stereochemical congruences that could lead to the identification of immunologic relevant regions. We used molecular dynamics and principal component analysis to study the protein in solution, for all four dengue serotypes, under distinct pH and temperature. We stated that, while the core of Domain III is remarkably rigid and effectively unaffected by most of the mentioned intensive variations, the loops account for major and distinguishable flexibilities. Therefore, the rigidity of the Domain III core provides a foothold that projects specifically two of these high flexible loop regions towards the inner face of the envelope pores, which are found at every five-fold symmetry axis of the icosahedron-shaped mature virus. These loops bear a remarkable low identity though with high occurrence of ionizable residues, including histidines. Such stereochemical properties can provide very particular serotype-specific electrostatic surface patterns, suggesting a viral fingerprint region, on which other specific molecules and ions can establish chemical interactions in an induced fit mechanism.

29282144,2017 Dec 28,Family level variation in Wolbachia-mediated dengue virus blocking in Aedes aegypti.,"BACKGROUND: The mosquito vector Aedes aegypti is responsible for transmitting a range of arboviruses including dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV). The global reach of these viruses is increasing due to an expansion of the mosquito's geographic range and increasing urbanization and human travel. Vector control remains the primary means for limiting these diseases. Wolbachia pipientis is an endosymbiotic bacterium of insects that has the ability to block the replication of pathogens, including flaviviruses such as DENV or ZIKV, inside the body of the vector. A strain of Wolbachia called wMel is currently being released into wild mosquito populations to test its potential to limit virus transmission to humans. The mechanism that underpins the virus blocking effect, however, remains elusive. METHODS: We used a modified full-sib breeding design in conjunction with vector competence assays in wildtype and wMel-infected Aedes aegypti collected from the field. All individuals were injected with DENV-2 intrathoracically at 5-6 days of age. Tissues were dissected 7 days post-infection to allow quantification of DENV and Wolbachia loads. RESULTS: We show the first evidence of family level variation in Wolbachia-mediated blocking in mosquitoes. This variation may stem from either genetic contributions from the mosquito and Wolbachia genomes or environmental influences on Wolbachia. In these families, we also tested for correlations between strength of blocking and expression level for several insect immunity genes with possible roles in blocking, identifying two genes of interest (AGO2 and SCP-2). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we show variation in Wolbachia-mediated DENV blocking in Aedes aegypti that may arise from genetic contributions and environmental influences on the mosquito-Wolbachia association. This suggests that Wolbachia-mediated blocking may have the ability to evolve through time or be expressed differentially across environments. The long-term efficacy of Wolbachia in the field will be dependent on the stability of blocking. Understanding the mechanism of blocking will be necessary for successful development of strategies that counter the emergence of evolved resistance or variation in its expression under diverse field conditions.

These included a C-to-T (16681-to-PDK-53) mutation at nucleotide position 57 of the 5'-untranslated region, three silent mutations, and substitutions prM-29 Asp to Val, NS1-53 Gly to Asp, NS2A-181 Leu to Phe, NS3-250 Glu to Val, and NS4A-75 Gly to Ala. Unpassaged PDK-53 vaccine contained two genetic variants as a result of partial mutation at NS3-250. We constructed infectious cDNA clones for 16681 virus and each of the two PDK-53 variants. DEN-2 16681 clone-derived viruses were identical to the 16681 virus in plaque size and replication in LLC-MK2 cells, replication in C6/36 cells, E and prM epitopes, and neurovirulence for suckling mice. PDK-53 virus and both clone-derived PDK-53 variants were attenuated in mice. However, the variant containing NS3-250-Glu was less temperature sensitive and replicated better in C6/36 cells than did PDK-53 virus. The variant containing NS3-250-Val had smaller, more diffuse plaques, decreased replication, and increased temperature sensitivity in LLC-MK2 cells relative to PDK-53 virus.

28186093,2017 Feb 10,Conformational changes in intact dengue virus reveal serotype-specific expansion.,"Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) alone undergoes structural expansion at 37 °C (associated with host entry), despite high sequence and structural homology among the four known serotypes. The basis for this differential expansion across strains and serotypes is unknown and necessitates mapping of the dynamics of dengue whole viral particles to describe their coordinated motions and conformational changes when exposed to host-like environments. Here we capture the dynamics of intact viral particles of two serotypes, DENV1 and DENV2, by amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) and time resolved Förster Resonance Energy Transfer. Our results show temperature-dependent dynamics hotspots on DENV2 and DENV1 particles with DENV1 showing expansion at 40 °C but not at 37 °C. HDXMS measurement of virion dynamics in solution offers a powerful approach to identify potential epitopes, map virus-antibody complex structure and dynamics, and test effects of multiple host-specific perturbations on viruses and virus-antibody complexes.

Here, we demonstrated DENV caused infection, including viral entry, RNA replication, viral protein expression, and virus release, in the murine microglial cell line BV2. DENV infection caused an increase in the formation of the multipolar phenotype in vitro and in vivo without affecting cell growth and cytotoxicity. DENV infection considerably increased cell motility and disrupting either actin filaments or clathrin retarded such effect. Increase in cell migration was only occurred by DENV infection following a clathrin-regulated endocytosis of DENV entry. Ultraviolet-inactivated DENV did not affect cell migration, and pharmacologically blocking toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR3-related signaling pathways reduced the DENV-induced increase in cell migration.

9191841,1997 Jun 9,Changes in the dengue virus major envelope protein on passaging and their localization on the three-dimensional structure of the protein.,"To help define the molecular events involved in dengue virus adaptation during serial passage in vivo and in cultured cells, we have sequenced the structural protein genes of three dengue type 3 isolates after intracerebral passage in mice and after passage in cultured monkey kidney (Vero) and Aedes albopictus (mosquito) cells. Passaging in each host selected for amino acid changes in the envelope protein E and occasionally in prM but not in the capsid protein. Most changes were first apparent within five passages. Nineteen of twenty mutations in the structural protein genes resulted in amino acid changes concentrated on 12 residues; 9 of the 12 amino acid changes were at residues which are conserved between the four dengue virus serotypes. Certain amino acid changes were repeatedly selected on passage in cell culture. In six independent Vero cell passage series, changes were observed in E at residues 191 (four times), 202 (twice), 266 and 268 (three times), and 291; change in prM was seen in two passage series at residue 26. Two independent passage series in mosquito cells each resulted in the loss of a conserved glycosylation site at Asn 153 in E. Passage in mouse brain selected for mutations at E residues 18, 54, 277, 401, and 403. Residues which altered on passaging have been localized on the three-dimensional structure of the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein soluble fragment (F. A.

24886023,2014 May 30,Infection with dengue-2 virus alters proteins in naturally expectorated saliva of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) is responsible for up to approximately 300 million infections and an increasing number of deaths related to severe manifestations each year in affected countries throughout the tropics. It is critical to understand the drivers of this emergence, including the role of vector-virus interactions. When a DENV-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a vertebrate, the virus is deposited along with a complex mixture of salivary proteins. However, the influence of a DENV infection upon the expectorated salivary proteome of its vector has yet to be determined. METHODS: Therefore, we conducted a proteomic analysis using 2-D gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry based protein identification comparing the naturally expectorated saliva of Aedes aegypti infected with DENV-2 relative to that of uninfected Aedes aegypti. RESULTS: Several proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the saliva of DENV-2 infected mosquitoes, in particular proteins with anti-hemostatic and pain inhibitory functions were significantly reduced. Hypothetical consequences of these particular protein reductions include increased biting rates and transmission success, and lead to alteration of transmission potential as calculated in our vectorial capacity model. CONCLUSIONS: We present our characterizations of these changes with regards to viral transmission and mosquito blood-feeding success. Further, we conclude that our proteomic analysis of Aedes aegypti saliva altered by DENV infection provides a unique opportunity to identify pro-viral impacts key to virus transmission.

For multi-serotype pathogens, however, different levels of serotype-specific immunity make it difficult to assess the population at risk. In this paper we propose a Bayesian method for estimation of the attack ratio of an epidemic and the initial fraction of susceptibles using aggregated incidence data. We derive the probability distribution of the effective reproductive number, Rt, and use MCMC to obtain posterior distributions of the parameters of a single-strain SIR transmission model with time-varying force of infection. Our method is showcased in a data set consisting of 18 years of dengue incidence in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn about the initial fraction of susceptibles and the attack ratio even in the absence of serotype specific data. On the other hand, the information provided by this approach is limited, stressing the need for detailed serological surveys to characterise the distribution of serotype-specific immunity in the population.

37896789,2023 Sep 27,Novel Potent Autophagy Inhibitor Ka-003 Inhibits Dengue Virus Replication.,"Every year, dengue virus (DENV) affects millions of people. Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of DENV infection. Autophagy is a conserved degradation process that was shown to be induced by DENV infection and required for optimal DENV replication. The modulation of autophagy is, therefore, considered an attractive target to treat DENV infection. This study carried out a high-content image screen analysis using Crispr-Cas9 GFP-LC3 knocked-in HeLa cells of a compound library synthesized from or inspired by natural products and their biocongener precursors to discover novel autophagy inhibitors. The screen identified Ka-003 as the most effective compound for decreasing the number of autophagic vacuoles inside cells upon autophagy induction. Ka-003 could inhibit autophagy in a dose-dependent manner at low micromolar concentrations. More importantly, Ka-003 demonstrated the concentration-dependent inhibition of DENV production in Crispr-Cas9 GFP-LC3 knocked-in THP-1 monocytes. The core structure of Ka-003, which is a methyl cyclohexene derivative, resembles those found in mulberry plants, and could be synthetically prepared in a bioinspired fashion. Taken together, data indicate that Ka-003 hampered autophagy and limited DENV replication. The low cytotoxicity of Ka-003 suggests its therapeutic potential, which warrants further studies for the lead optimization of the compound for dengue treatment. 10400, Thailand.

27334982,2016 Sep,Targeted full-genome amplification and sequencing of dengue virus types 1-4 from South America.,"We report optimized workflows for full-genome sequencing of dengue viruses (DENVs) 1-4. Based on alignments of publicly available complete genomes we modified and expanded existing primers sets to amplify DENV genotypes that were previously difficult or impossible to sequence. We also report improvements to streamline laboratory handling, including a dual amplification strategy for easy and difficult to sequence ""high-copy"" and ""low-copy"" templates, respectively, and normalization of PCR cycling conditions across serotypes. High-copy templates can be sequenced following amplification of as few as 5 overlapping segments covering the complete viral genome, whereas low-copy templates can be sequenced following amplification of no more than 10 overlapping segments of smaller size. These changes have been validated using a balanced set of wild-type DENV genomes (11 of DENV1, 14 of DENV2, 13 of DENV3 and 7 of DENV4) derived from human serum samples collected throughout South America over the past 15 years. The changes described enable generation of complete DENV genomes from wild-type samples without the need for viral enrichment via passaging through laboratory cell lines. This should facilitate quick and cost-effective generation of DENV full-genome sequences of the type needed for accurate epidemiological surveillance and thorough evolutionary studies of wild-type DENVs.

22178263,2012 Feb 5,Genetic and phenotypic characterization of sylvatic dengue virus type 4 strains.,"Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1-4) currently circulate between humans and domestic/peridomestic Aedes mosquitoes, resulting in 100 million infections per year. All four serotypes emerged, independently, from sylvatic progenitors transmitted among non-human primates by arboreal Aedes mosquitoes. This study investigated the genetic and phenotypic changes associated with emergence of human DENV-4 from its sylvatic ancestors. Analysis of complete genomes of 3 sylvatic and 4 human strains revealed high conservation of both the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions but considerable divergence within the open reading frame. Additionally, the two ecotypes did not differ significantly in replication dynamics in cultured human liver (Huh-7), monkey kidney (Vero) or mosquito (C6/36) cells, although significant inter-strain variation within ecotypes was detected. These findings are in partial agreement with previous studies of DENV-2, where human strains produced a larger number of progeny than sylvatic strains in human liver cells but not in monkey or mosquito cells.

24628767,2014 Mar 14,Extensive haemorrhagic necrosis of liver is an unpredictable fatal complication in dengue infection: a postmortem study.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue infection carries a potential risk of death despite stringent management of plasma leak and haemorrhage. It appears that the extent of liver dysfunction determines the outcome. METHODS: We present a postmortem study of five patients, died of dengue shock syndrome who had markedly elevated liver enzymes and irreparable circulatory failure. RESULTS: All were females with a median age of 46 years (range 20-50 years). All had positive NS1 and IgM. Clinically, one patient developed severe degree of hepatic encephalopathy whilst three patients developed uncontrollable bleeding manifestations. Dengue virus was detected in three liver specimens by reverse transcription PCR. Histology of the liver revealed massive necrosis with haemorrhages in these patients with evidence of micro and macrovesicular steatosis with significant periportal inflammatory infiltrate. No significant ischaemic changes or necrosis was observed in the other organs. CONCLUSIONS: Severe haemorrhagic necrosis of the liver was the cause of death in these patients probably due to direct viral infection. Predilection for severe liver disease remains unknown. Therefore, it is prudent to think beyond plasma leak as the main pathology of dengue infection and attempts should be made to develop other treatment modalities to prevent and manage unforeseen fatal complications of dengue infection.","['Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure/*pathology/*virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis/virology', 'Severe Dengue/*pathology', 'Young Adult']","['BACKGROUND: Dengue infection carries a potential risk of death despite stringent management of plasma leak and haemorrhage.', 'It appears that the extent of liver dysfunction determines the outcome.', 'METHODS: We present a postmortem study of five patients, died of dengue shock syndrome who had markedly elevated liver enzymes and irreparable circulatory failure.', 'RESULTS: All were females with a median age of 46\xa0years (range 20-50\xa0years).', 'All had positive NS1 and IgM.

26572227,2015 Nov 14,Development of reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid detection and differentiation of dengue virus serotypes 1-4.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV), the most widely prevalent arbovirus, continues to be a threat to human health in the tropics and subtropics. Early and rapid detection of DENV infection during the acute phase of illness is crucial for proper clinical patient management and preventing the spread of infection. The aim of the current study was to develop a specific, sensitive, and robust reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection and differentiation of DENV1-4 serotypes. RESULTS: The method detection primers, which were designed to target the different DENV serotypes, were identified by inspection of multiple sequence alignments of the non-structural protein (NS) 2A of DENV1, NS4B of DENV2, NS4A of DENV3 and the 3' untranslated region of the NS protein of DENV4. No cross-reactions of the four serotypes were observed during the tests. The detection limits of the DENV1-4-specific RT-LAMP assays were approximately 10-copy templates per reaction. The RT-LAMP assays were ten-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR or real-time PCR. The diagnostic rate was 100% for clinical strains of DENV, and 98.9% of the DENV-infected patients whose samples were tested were detected by RT-LAMP. Importantly, no false-positives were detected with the new equipment and methodology that was used to avoid aerosol contamination of the samples. CONCLUSION: The RT-LAMP method used in our study is specific, sensitive, and suitable for further investigation as a useful alternative to the current methods used for clinical diagnosis of DENV1-4, especially in hospitals and laboratories that lack sophisticated diagnostic systems. and Children's Medical Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, 74 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Guangzhou, 510080, China. hushengfengsysu@126.com.

28973490,2017 Jul 1,"Circulation of DENV2 and DENV4 in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes from Praia, Santiago Island, Cabo Verde.","Arthropod-borne viruses, such as Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV), pose a challenge to public health, due to their worldwide distribution and large-scale outbreaks. Dengue fever is currently one of the most important diseases and it is caused by four serotypes of DENV and is mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. It is estimated that 50-100 million cases are reported every year worldwide. More recently, CHIKV and ZIKV, which are also transmitted by Ae. aegypti, have caused epidemics in countries in the Caribbean region, the Pacific region, and Americas. Cabo Verde faced its first dengue outbreak in 2009, with more than 21,000 reported cases and four registered deaths. The epidemic was caused by DENV-3 transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. In addition, the country faced a Zika outbreak with more than 7,500 notified cases from October 2015 to May 2016. In the present study, we conducted a survey in mosquito samples to detect arboviruses circulating in the local vector population. Collections were performed from November 2014 to January 2015, in the City of Praia, the capital of Cabo Verde, using aspirators and BG-sentinel traps. Samples were examined by multiplex Reverse Transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 161 Ae. aegypti adult females were analyzed (34 pools) and from these samples, eight pools were found positive for DENV-2 and DENV-4. Our results revealed a very high natural infection rate in the vector population and showed two different serotypes co-circulating in the island that differ from the one detected in the 2009 outbreak in Cabo Verde.

For all three serotypes, we estimated that the introduction of new lineages occurred within 7 to 10-year intervals. New lineages were most likely to be imported from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and then to disperse at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day.

21813859,2011 Aug,Decay and persistence of maternal dengue antibodies among infants in Bangkok.,"Abstract. Maternal dengue antibodies are important in determining the optimal age of dengue vaccination, but no study has quantified the heterogeneity of antibody decay and persistence in infants. We used longitudinal regression methods and survival analysis to measure decay and persistence times of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies in 139 infants in Bangkok. A biphasic decay pattern was found with half-life times of 24-29 days between birth and 3 months and 44-150 days after 3 months. Atypical decay rates were found in 17% of infants for dengue virus-1 and -4. Median persistence times of plaque reduction neutralization tests > 10 ranged from 6 to 9 months. Persistence times for individuals could not be predicted based on antibody values at birth. Vaccination against dengue before 12 months of age would be ineffective if maternal antibodies at plaque reduction neutralization test levels below 80 interfere with vaccine uptake. Projections of average antibody persistence based on values at birth should be avoided in studies on dengue pathogenesis in infants.

Several factors may affect the transmission of dengue in Africa, including vector efficiency, viral infectivity, host vulnerability and environmental factors, such as increasing urbanisation.

33923511,2021 Apr 16,Adaptive Evolution of New Variants of Dengue Virus Serotype 1 Genotype V Circulating in the Brazilian Amazon.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne viral pathogen that plagues many tropical-climate nations around the world, including Brazil. Molecular epidemiology is a growing and increasingly invaluable tool for understanding the dispersal, persistence, and diversity of this impactful virus. In this study, plasma samples (n = 824) from individuals with symptoms consistent with an arboviral febrile illness were analyzed to identity the molecular epidemiological dynamics of DENV circulating in the Brazilian state of Amapá. Twelve DENV type 1 (DENV-1) genomes were identified, which were phylogenetically related to the BR4 lineage of genotype V. Phylodynamics analysis suggested that DENV-1 BR-4 was introduced into Amapá around early 2010, possibly from other states in northern Brazil. We also found unique amino acids substitutions in the DENV-1 envelope and NS5 protein sequences in the Amapá isolates. Characterization of the DENV-1 BR-4 sequences highlights the potential of this new lineage to drive outbreaks of dengue in the Amazon region. Federal do Pará, Belem 66075-000, Brazil.

These viruses appear to be rapidly displacing the American genotype of DEN-2 in the Western Hemisphere. To determine whether distinct genotypes of DEN-2 virus are better adapted to mosquito transmission, we classified 15 viral strains of DEN-2 phylogenetically and compared their ability to infect and disseminate in different populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Envelope gene nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that six strains belonged to the American genotype and nine strains were of the SE Asian genotype. The overall rate of disseminated infection in mosquitoes from Texas was 27% for the SE Asian genotype versus 9% for the American genotype. This pattern of infection was similar in another population of mosquitoes sampled from southern Mexico (30% versus 13%). Together, these findings suggest that Ae. aegypti tends to be more susceptible to infection by DEN-2 viruses of the SE Asian genotype than to those of the American genotype, and this may have epidemiologic implications.

27575636,2016 Aug,The Dengue Virus NS5 Protein Intrudes in the Cellular Spliceosome and Modulates Splicing.,"Dengue virus NS5 protein plays multiple functions in the cytoplasm of infected cells, enabling viral RNA replication and counteracting host antiviral responses. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of NS5 in the nucleus where it interferes with cellular splicing. Using global proteomic analysis of infected cells together with functional studies, we found that NS5 binds spliceosome complexes and modulates endogenous splicing as well as minigene-derived alternative splicing patterns. In particular, we show that NS5 alone, or in the context of viral infection, interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP particle, CD2BP2 and DDX23, alters the inclusion/exclusion ratio of alternative splicing events, and changes mRNA isoform abundance of known antiviral factors. Interestingly, a genome wide transcriptome analysis, using recently developed bioinformatics tools, revealed an increase of intron retention upon dengue virus infection, and viral replication was improved by silencing specific U5 components. Different mechanistic studies indicate that binding of NS5 to the spliceosome reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA processing, independently of NS5 enzymatic activities. We propose that NS5 binding to U5 snRNP proteins hijacks the splicing machinery resulting in a less restrictive environment for viral replication.

26416112,2015 Dec,Feasibility of Using the Mosquito Blood Meal for Rapid and Efficient Human and Animal Virus Surveillance and Discovery.,"Mosquito blood meals taken from humans and animals potentially represent a useful source of blood for the detection of blood-borne pathogens. In this feasibility study, Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed with blood meals spiked with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) and harvested at serial time points. These mosquitoes are not competent vectors, and the virus is not expected to replicate. Ingested blood was spotted on Whatman FTA cards and stored at room temperature. Mosquito abdomens were removed and stored at -80°C. Control blood meal aliquots were stored in vials or applied onto FTA cards. After 4 weeks of storage, the samples were extracted using beadbeating and QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD). Recovered viral RNA was analyzed by DENV-2 TaqMan RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Overall viral RNA recovery efficiency was 15% from the directly applied dried blood spots and approximately 20% or higher for dried blood spots made by blotting mosquito midgut on FTA cards. Viral RNA in mosquito-ingested blood decreases over time, but remains detectable 24 hours after blood feeding. The viral sequences in FTA-stored specimens can be maintained at room temperature. The strategy has the potential utility in expedited zoonotic virus discovery and blood-borne pathogen surveillance.

9811707,1998 Dec,Study of Dengue virus infection in SCID mice engrafted with human K562 cells.,"Here we report that severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice engrafted with human K562 cells (K562-SCID mice) can be used as an animal model to study dengue virus (DEN) infection. After intratumor injection into K562 cell masses of PL046, a Taiwanese DEN-2 human isolate, the K562-SCID mice showed neurological signs of paralysis and died at approximately 2 weeks postinfection. In addition to being detected in the tumor masses, high virus titers were detected in the peripheral blood and the brain tissues, indicating that DEN had replicated in the infected K562-SCID mice. In contrast, the SCID mice were resistant to DEN infection and the mock-infected K562-SCID mice survived for over 3 months. These data illustrate that DEN infection contributed directly to the deaths of the infected K562-SCID mice. Other serotypes of DEN were also used to infect the K562-SCID mice, and the mortality rates of the infected mice varied with different challenge strains, suggesting the existence of diverse degrees of virulence among DENs. To determine whether a neutralizing antibody against DEN in vitro was also protective in vivo, the K562-SCID mice were challenged with DEN-2 and received antibody administration at the same time or 1 day earlier. Our results revealed that the antibody-treated mice exhibited a reduction in mortality and a delay of paralysis onset after DEN infection. In contrast to K562-SCID, the persistently DEN-infected K562 cells generated in vitro invariably failed to be implanted in the mice. It seems that in the early stage of implantation, a gamma interferon activated, nitric oxide-mediated anti-DEN effect might play a role in the innate immunity against DEN-infected cells.

32759331,2020 Aug 5,A Critical Role for Perivascular Cells in Amplifying Vascular Leakage Induced by Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1.,"Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, with severe dengue typified by potentially fatal microvascular leakage and hypovolemic shock. Blood vessels of the microvasculature are composed of a tubular structure of endothelial cells ensheathed by perivascular cells (pericytes). Pericytes support endothelial cell barrier formation and maintenance through paracrine and contact-mediated signaling and are critical to microvascular integrity. Pericyte dysfunction has been linked to vascular leakage in noncommunicable pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy but has never been linked to infection-related vascular leakage. Dengue vascular leakage has been shown to result in part from the direct action of the secreted dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein NS1 on endothelial cells. Using primary human vascular cells, we show here that NS1 also causes pericyte dysfunction and that NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability is more pronounced in the presence of pericytes. Notably, NS1 specifically disrupted the ability of pericytes to support endothelial cell function in a three-dimensional (3D) microvascular assay, with no effect on pericyte viability or physiology. These effects are mediated at least in part through contact-independent paracrine signals involved in endothelial barrier maintenance by pericytes. We therefore identify a role for pericytes in amplifying NS1-induced microvascular hyperpermeability in severe dengue and thus show that pericytes can play a critical role in the etiology of an infectious vascular leakage syndrome. These findings open new avenues of research for the development of drugs and diagnostic assays for combating infection-induced vascular leakage, such as severe dengue.IMPORTANCE The World Health Organization considers dengue one of the top 10 global public health problems. There is no specific antiviral therapy to treat dengue virus and no way of predicting which patients will develop potentially fatal severe dengue, typified by vascular leakage and circulatory shock. We show here that perivascular cells (pericytes) amplify the vascular leakage-inducing effects of the dengue viral protein NS1 through contact-independent signaling to endothelial cells. While pericytes are known to contribute to noncommunicable vascular leakage, this is the first time these cells have been implicated in the vascular effects of an infectious disease. Our findings could pave the way for new therapies and diagnostics to combat dengue and potentially other infectious vascular leakage syndromes.

6766903,1980 Jan,Dengue-2 vaccine: viremia and immune responses in rhesus monkeys.,"Studies were undertaken in Indian rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to determine the safety, potency, immunogenicity, and mosquito infectivity of a small-plaque, temperature-sensitive variant of dengue type 2 (DEN-2) virus, a vaccine candidate. Fifteen monkeys were inoculated subcutaneously with the vaccine virus, ten receiving 10(3.1) plaque-forming units (PFU) and five receiving 10(4.5) PFU. After primary immunization, viremia was detected in only one monkey, a recipient of the higher dose of vaccine. The recovered virus had the same growth characteristics as the vaccine strain. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes did not become infected when they were allowed to feed on monkeys that received the lower dose of vaccine. As expected, the immunization produced no evidence of illness in any of the animals. A dose response to vaccine was detected; all five of the high-dose recipients developed neutralizing antibodies, whereas only five of ten low-dose recipients did so. In both groups, neutralizing antibody was often transient. Its presence at 30 days did not always correlate with protection from viremia in those animals challenged 4 to 6 months after vaccination with wild-type DEN-2 virus. However, immunized animals developed anamnestic antibody responses after challenge, and none demonstrated adverse effects to infection.

25878113,2015 Jul,Mutation of Putative N-Glycosylation Sites on Dengue Virus NS4B Decreases RNA Replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated protein, and mutagenesis studies have revealed its significance in viral genome replication. In this work, we demonstrated that NS4B is an N-glycosylated protein in virus-infected cells as well as in recombinant protein expression. NS4B is N glycosylated at residues 58 and 62 and exists in two forms, glycosylated and unglycosylated. We manipulated full-length infectious RNA clones and subgenomic replicons to generate N58Q, N62Q, and N58QN62Q mutants. Each of the single mutants had distinct effects, but the N58QN62Q mutation resulted in dramatic reduction of viral production efficiency without affecting secretion or infectivity of the virion in mammalian and mosquito C6/36 hosts. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), subgenomic replicon, and trans-complementation assays indicated that the N58QN62Q mutation affected RNA replication possibly by the loss of glycans. In addition, four intragenic mutations (S59Y, S59F, T66A, and A137T) were obtained from mammalian and/or mosquito C6/36 cell culture systems. All of these second-site mutations compensated for the replication defect of the N58QN62Q mutant without creating novel glycosylation sites. In vivo protein stability analyses revealed that the N58QN62Q mutation alone or plus a compensatory mutation did not affect the stability of NS4B. Overall, our findings indicated that mutation of putative N-glycosylation sites affected the biological function of NS4B in the viral replication complex. IMPORTANCE: This is the first report to identify and reveal the biological significance of dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) posttranslation N-glycosylation to the virus life cycle. The study demonstrated that NS4B is N glycosylated in virus-infected cells and in recombinant protein expression. NS4B is modified by glycans at Asn-58 and Asn-62. Functional characterization implied that DENV NS4B utilizes the glycosylation machinery in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. Four intragenic mutations were found to compensate for replication and subsequent viral production deficiencies without creating novel N-glycosylation sites or modulating the stabilities of the protein, suggesting that glycans may be involved in maintaining the NS4B protein conformation. NS4B glycans may be necessary elements of the viral life cycle, but compensatory mutations can circumvent their requirement. This novel finding may have broader implications in flaviviral biology as the most likely glycan at Asn-62 of NS4B is conserved in DENV serotypes and in some related flaviviruses. of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Centre and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. hnwu@gate.sinica.edu.tw.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation, Missense', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']","['Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated protein, and mutagenesis studies have revealed its significance in viral genome replication.', 'In this work, we demonstrated that NS4B is an N-glycosylated protein in virus-infected cells as well as in recombinant protein expression.', 'NS4B is N glycosylated at residues 58 and 62 and exists in two forms, glycosylated and unglycosylated.', 'We manipulated full-length infectious RNA clones and subgenomic replicons to generate N58Q, N62Q, and N58QN62Q mutants.', 'Each of the single mutants had distinct effects, but the N58QN62Q mutation resulted in dramatic reduction of viral production efficiency without affecting secretion or infectivity of the virion in mammalian and mosquito C6/36 hosts.', 'Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), subgenomic replicon, and trans-complementation assays indicated that the N58QN62Q mutation affected RNA replication possibly by the loss of glycans.', 'In addition, four intragenic mutations (S59Y, S59F, T66A, and A137T) were obtained from mammalian and/or mosquito C6/36 cell culture systems.', 'All of these second-site mutations compensated for the replication defect of the N58QN62Q mutant without creating novel glycosylation sites.', 'In vivo protein stability analyses revealed that the N58QN62Q mutation alone or plus a compensatory mutation did not affect the stability of NS4B.', 'Overall, our findings indicated that mutation of putative N-glycosylation sites affected the biological function of NS4B in the viral replication complex.', 'IMPORTANCE: This is the first report to identify and reveal the biological significance of dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) posttranslation N-glycosylation to the virus life cycle.', 'The study demonstrated that NS4B is N glycosylated in virus-infected cells and in recombinant protein expression.', 'NS4B is modified by glycans at Asn-58 and Asn-62.', 'Functional characterization implied that DENV NS4B utilizes the glycosylation machinery in both mammalian and mosquito hosts.', 'Four intragenic mutations were found to compensate for replication and subsequent viral production deficiencies without creating novel N-glycosylation sites or modulating the stabilities of the protein, suggesting that glycans may be involved in maintaining the NS4B protein conformation.', 'NS4B glycans may be necessary elements of the viral life cycle, but compensatory mutations can circumvent their requirement.', 'This novel finding may have broader implications in flaviviral biology as the most likely glycan at Asn-62 of NS4B is conserved in DENV serotypes and in some related flaviviruses.', 'of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Centre and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'hnwu@gate.sinica.edu.tw.']"

31351235,2019 Nov,"Genotype replacement of dengue virus type 3 and clade replacement of dengue virus type 2 genotype Cosmopolitan in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2017.","Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has spread to >100 countries and is caused by the dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV comprises 4 serotypes (DENV-1 to -4), and each serotype is further divided into distinct genotypes. In India, it is reported that all 4 serotypes of DENV co-circulate. Although Bangladesh is a neighboring country of India, very few reports have published DENV sequence data for the country, especially after 2012. To understand the current distribution of DENV genotypes in Bangladesh, we determined the nucleotide sequences of envelope regions obtained from 58 DENV-positive patients diagnosed at Apollo Hospitals Dhaka during the period between September 2017 and February 2018. We found 5 DENV-1, 47 DENV-2, and 6 DENV-3 serotypes. A phylogenetic analysis of the obtained viral sequences revealed that DENV-3 genotype I was present instead of DENV-3 genotype II, which was predominant in Bangladesh between 2000 and 2009. Furthermore, we found two distinct lineages of the Cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2, one of which was closely related to strains from Southeast Asia and has never been reported previously in Bangladesh. These results indicated that DENVs in Bangladesh have increased in genotypic diversity and suggest that the DENV genotypic shift observed in other Asian countries also might have been taking place in Bangladesh.

21103381,2010 Nov 16,Best practices in dengue surveillance: a report from the Asia-Pacific and Americas Dengue Prevention Boards.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a virus infection that is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and can cause severe disease especially in children. Dengue fever is a major problem in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited dengue experts from around the world to attend meetings to discuss dengue surveillance. We reviewed literature, heard detailed reports on surveillance programs, and shared expert opinions. RESULTS: Presentations by 22 countries were heard during the 2.5 day meetings. We describe the best methods of surveillance in general, the stakeholders in dengue surveillance, and the steps from mosquito bite to reporting of a dengue case to explore how best to carry out dengue surveillance. We also provide details and a comparison of the dengue surveillance programs by the presenting countries. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The experts provided recommendations for achieving the best possible data from dengue surveillance accepting the realities of the real world (e.g., limited funding and staff). Their recommendations included: (1) Every dengue endemic country should make reporting of dengue cases to the government mandatory; (2) electronic reporting systems should be developed and used; (3) at minimum dengue surveillance data should include incidence, hospitalization rates, deaths by age group; (4) additional studies should be completed to check the sensitivity of the system; (5) laboratories should share expertise and data; (6) tests that identify dengue virus should be used in patients with fever for four days or less and antibody tests should be used after day 4 to diagnose dengue; and (7) early detection and prediction of dengue outbreaks should be goals for national surveillance systems.

21185332,2011 Feb,Anthracene-based inhibitors of dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has strained global healthcare systems throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In addition to plaguing developing nations, it has re-emerged in several developed countries with recent outbreaks in the USA (CDC, 2010), Australia (Hanna et al., 2009), Taiwan (Kuan et al., 2010) and France (La Ruche et al., 2010). DENV infection can cause significant disease, including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome, and death. There are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies to prevent or treat dengue-related illnesses. However, the viral NS2B-NS3 protease complex provides a strategic target for antiviral drug development since NS3 protease activity is required for virus replication. Recently, we reported two compounds with inhibitory activity against the DENV protease in vitro and antiviral activity against dengue 2 (DEN2V) in cell culture (Tomlinson et al., 2009a). Analogs of one of the lead compounds were purchased, tested in protease inhibition assays, and the data evaluated with detailed kinetic analyses. A structure activity relationship (SAR) identified key atomic determinants (i.e. functional groups) important for inhibitory activity. Four ""second series"" analogs were selected and tested to validate our SAR and structural models. Here, we report improvements to inhibitory activity ranging between ∼2- and 60-fold, resulting in selective low micromolar dengue protease inhibitors.

20696556,2010 Nov,Dengue conundrums.,"Dengue virus is the most common arboviral infection of humans in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This review briefly describes some of the challenges it presents. Dengue is an emerging disease; it is increasing in geographical distribution and severity, despite being significantly underreported. The World Health Organization case definition for the generally more severe manifestation of infection, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), is controversial. The name DHF is something of a misnomer as the disease infrequently results in frank haemorrhage; the hallmark of DHF is actually plasma leakage. The existence of four closely related dengue virus serotypes contributes to difficulties in diagnosis and to original antigenic sin in the serological response to infection. The existence of multiple serotypes can result in more severe disease upon a second infection and complicates vaccine development. Nevertheless, a safe and effective vaccine is the greatest prospect for stemming the tide of dengue.

It is crucial that circulating DENV strains are identified and monitored, and that their transmission efficiency and association with disease severity is understood. In this study, we analyzed DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 serotypes in 1235 serum samples collected in Myanmar between 2017 and 2019. Whole-genome sequencing of DENV-1-4 demonstrated that most DENV-1-4 strains had been circulating in Myanmar for several years. We also identified the emergence of DENV-3 genotype-I in 2017 samples, which persisted through 2018 and 2019. The emergence of the strain coincided with a period of increased DENV-3 cases and marked changes in the serotype dynamics. Nevertheless, we detected no significant differences between serum viral loads, disease severity, and infection status of individuals infected with different DENV serotypes during the 3-year study. Our results not only identify the spread of a new DENV-3 genotype into Yangon, Myanmar, but also support the importance of DENV evolution in changing the epidemic dynamics in endemic regions.

From August 2009-January 2010, 212 dengue cases were confirmed among 396 study participants at the National Pediatric Reference Hospital. In our parallel community-based cohort study, 170 dengue cases were recorded in 2009-10, compared to 13-65 cases in 2004-9. In both studies, significantly more patients experienced ""compensated shock"" (poor capillary refill plus cold extremities, tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or weak pulse) in 2009-10 than in previous years (42.5% [90/212] vs. 24.7% [82/332] in the hospital study (p<0.001) and 17% [29/170] vs. 2.2% [4/181] in the cohort study (p<0.001).

24324976,2013,Proteomic identification of dengue virus binding proteins in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and Aedes albopictus cells.,"The main vector of dengue in America is the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is infected by dengue virus (DENV) through receptors of midgut epithelial cells. The envelope protein (E) of dengue virus binds to receptors present on the host cells through its domain III that has been primarily recognized to bind cell receptors. In order to identify potential receptors, proteins from mosquito midgut tissue and C6/36 cells were purified by affinity using columns with the recombinant E protein domain III (rE-DIII) or DENV particles bound covalently to Sepharose 4B to compare and evaluate their performance to bind proteins including putative receptors from female mosquitoes of Ae. aegypti. To determine their identity mass spectrometric analysis of purified proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. Our results indicate that both viral particles and rE-DIII bound proteins with the same apparent molecular weights of 57 and 67 kDa. In addition, viral particles bound high molecular weight proteins.

24468533,2014 Mar,Global spread of dengue virus types: mapping the 70 year history.,"Since the first isolation of dengue virus (DENV) in 1943, four types have been identified. Global phenomena such as urbanization and international travel are key factors in facilitating the spread of dengue. Documenting the type-specific record of DENV spread has important implications for understanding patterns in dengue hyperendemicity and disease severity as well as vaccine design and deployment strategies.

23986788,2013,Space constrained homology modelling: the paradigm of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of dengue (type II) virus.,"Protein structure is more conserved than sequence in nature. In this direction we developed a novel methodology that significantly improves conventional homology modelling when sequence identity is low, by taking into consideration 3D structural features of the template, such as size and shape. Herein, our new homology modelling approach was applied to the homology modelling of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of dengue (type II) virus. The RdRp of dengue was chosen due to the low sequence similarity shared between the dengue virus polymerase and the available templates, while purposely avoiding to use the actual X-ray structure that is available for the dengue RdRp. The novel approach takes advantage of 3D space corresponding to protein shape and size by creating a 3D scaffold of the template structure. The dengue polymerase model built by the novel approach exhibited all features of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and was almost identical to the X-ray structure of the dengue RdRp, as opposed to the model built by conventional homology modelling. Therefore, we propose that the space-aided homology modelling approach can be of a more general use to homology modelling of enzymes sharing low sequence similarity with the template structures.

33686914,2021 Dec,Viral evolution sustains a dengue outbreak of enhanced severity.,"Compared to the previous 2013-2014 outbreak, dengue 2016-2017 outbreak in New Caledonia was characterized by an increased number of severe forms associated with hepatic presentations. In this study, we assessed the virological factors associated with this enhanced severity. Whole-genome sequences were retrieved from dengue virus (DENV)-1 strains collected in 2013-2014 and from severe and non-severe patients in 2016-2017. Fitness, hepatic tropism and cytopathogenicity of DENV 2016-2017 strains were compared to those of 2013-2014 strains using replication kinetics in the human hepatic cell line HuH7. Whole-genome sequencing identified four amino acid substitutions specific to 2016-2017 strains and absent from 2013-2014 strains. Three of these mutations occurred in predicted T cell epitopes, among which one was also a B cell epitope. Strains retrieved from severe forms did not exhibit specific genetic features. DENV strains from 2016-2017 exhibited a trend towards reduced replicative fitness and cytopathogenicity in vitro compared to strains from 2013-2014. Overall, the 2016-2017 dengue outbreak in New Caledonia was associated with a viral genetic evolution which had limited impact on DENV hepatic tropism and cytopathogenicity. These mutations, however, may have modified DENV strains antigenicity, altering the anti-DENV immune response in some patients, in turn favoring the development of severe forms.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04615364.

26818736,2016 Jan 28,Cross-protection induced by Japanese encephalitis vaccines against different genotypes of Dengue viruses in mice.,"Dengue viruses (DENVs) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are closely related mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause very high global disease burdens. Although cross-reactivity and cross-protection within flaviviruses have been demonstrated, the effect of JEV vaccination on susceptibility to DENV infection has not been well elucidated. In this study, we found that vaccination with the JEV inactivated vaccine (INV) and live attenuated vaccine (LAV) could induce cross-immune responses and cross-protection against DENV1-4 in mice. Despite the theoretical risk of immune enhancement, no increased mortality was observed in our mouse model. Additionally, low but consistently detectable cross-neutralizing antibodies against DENV2 and DENV3 were also observed in the sera of JEV vaccine-immunized human donors. The results suggested that both JEV-LAV and JEV-INV could elicit strong cross-immunity and protection against DENVs, indicating that inoculation with JEV vaccines may influence the distribution of DENVs in co-circulated areas and that the cross-protection induced by JEV vaccines against DENVs might provide important information in terms of DENV prevention.

28325921,2017 Mar 22,Zika virus genome biology and molecular pathogenesis.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging RNA virus in the widespread Flavivirus genus. Recently, ZIKV has rapidly spread around the world and has been implicated in human disease, including neurological disorders, triggering public and scientific attention. Understanding how ZIKV causes disease is the highest priority, yet little is known about this virus. Here we examine the currently published data from ZIKV studies to provide the latest understanding of ZIKV genome biology and molecular pathogenesis. The ZIKV genome evolved rapidly from the Flavivirus genus and diverged from the members of this genus, even within the dengue virus cluster to which ZIKV belongs. Genome variations and divergences also exist among ZIKV strains/isolates. These genome divergences might account for the uniqueness of Zika disease. ZIKV infection activates not only the antiviral immune response but also the pro-inflammatory responses associated with disease symptoms. Strikingly, ZIKV activates protein complexes that are functionally associated with disease process, such as glial cell activation and proliferation (for example, Toll-like receptors), apoptosis and cell death, and inflammation. The activation of these complexes may critically contribute to Zika disease. The novel insights into ZIKV genome divergence and disease mechanisms summarized in this review will help accelerate the development of anti-ZIKV strategies. Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.

26735137,2016 Jan,Characterization of RyDEN (C19orf66) as an Interferon-Stimulated Cellular Inhibitor against Dengue Virus Replication.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arthropod-borne pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases in humans. However, no vaccine or specific antiviral is available for dengue. As seen in other RNA viruses, the innate immune system plays a key role in controlling DENV infection and disease outcome. Although the interferon (IFN) response, which is central to host protective immunity, has been reported to limit DENV replication, the molecular details of how DENV infection is modulated by IFN treatment are elusive. In this study, by employing a gain-of-function screen using a type I IFN-treated cell-derived cDNA library, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C19orf66, as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that inhibits DENV replication, which we named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN). Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments revealed that expression of RyDEN confers resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN expression also limited the replication of hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, Chikungunya virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human adenovirus. Importantly, RyDEN was considered to be a crucial effector molecule in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. When affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was performed, RyDEN was revealed to form a complex with cellular mRNA-binding proteins, poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), and La motif-related protein 1 (LARP1). Interestingly, PABPC1 and LARP1 were found to be positive modulators of DENV replication. Since RyDEN influenced intracellular events on DENV replication and, suppression of protein synthesis from DENV-based reporter construct RNA was also observed in RyDEN-expressing cells, our data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells. of Singapore, Singapore. of Singapore, Singapore. of Singapore, Singapore. of Singapore, Singapore. of Singapore, Singapore. of Singapore, Singapore.

25906260,2015 Apr,Dual miRNA targeting restricts host range and attenuates neurovirulence of flaviviruses.,"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are among the most significant arboviral pathogens worldwide. Vaccinations and mosquito population control programs remain the most reliable means for flavivirus disease prevention, and live attenuated viruses remain one of the most attractive flavivirus vaccine platforms. Some live attenuated viruses are capable of infecting principle mosquito vectors, as demonstrated in the laboratory, which in combination with their intrinsic genetic instability could potentially lead to a vaccine virus reversion back to wild-type in nature, followed by introduction and dissemination of potentially dangerous viral strains into new geographic locations. To mitigate this risk we developed a microRNA-targeting approach that selectively restricts replication of flavivirus in the mosquito host. Introduction of sequences complementary to a mosquito-specific mir-184 and mir-275 miRNAs individually or in combination into the 3'NCR and/or ORF region resulted in selective restriction of dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) replication in mosquito cell lines and adult Aedes mosquitos. Moreover a combined targeting of DEN4 genome with mosquito-specific and vertebrate CNS-specific mir-124 miRNA can silence viral replication in two evolutionally distant biological systems: mosquitoes and mouse brains. Thus, this approach can reinforce the safety of newly developed or existing vaccines for use in humans and could provide an additional level of biosafety for laboratories using viruses with altered pathogenic or transmissibility characteristics.

35736223,2022 Jul 8,Insights into the product release mechanism of dengue virus NS3 helicase.,"The non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3h) is a multifunctional protein that is critical in RNA replication and other stages in the flavivirus life cycle. NS3h uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along single stranded nucleic acid and to unwind double stranded RNA. Here we present a detailed mechanistic analysis of the product release stage in the catalytic cycle of the dengue virus (DENV) NS3h. This study is based on a combined experimental and computational approach of product-inhibition studies and free energy calculations. Our results support a model in which the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis proceeds through an ordered sequential mechanism that includes a ternary complex intermediate (NS3h-Pi-ADP), which evolves releasing the first product, phosphate (Pi), and subsequently ADP. Our results indicate that in the product release stage of the DENV NS3h a novel open-loop conformation plays an important role that may be conserved in NS3 proteins of other flaviviruses as well.

17160194,2006 Nov,Early Dengue infection and outcome study (EDEN) - study design and preliminary findings.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a major public health problem in Singapore. Age-specific dengue morbidity rates are highest in the young adult population, unlike in many other Southeast Asian countries where dengue is mainly a paediatric disease. Hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on dengue diagnosis and management which were developed using the paediatric experiences, may not be suitable for the management of adult dengue infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Early DENgue (EDEN) infection and outcome study is a collaborative longitudinal study to investigate epidemiological, clinical, viral and host-specific features of early dengue-infected adults, in an effort to identify new early markers for prognostication. Patients presenting with early undifferentiated fever were included in the study. We carried out an interim analysis to look for early indicators of severe disease. RESULTS: During the period of this interim study analysis, 455 febrile patients were recruited. Of these, 133 were confirmed as acute dengue cases based on dengue-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. There were significant clinical and epidemiological differences between dengue and febrile non-dengue cases. Nine per cent of the dengue cases experienced persistent tiredness, drowsiness and loss of appetite beyond 3 weeks of illness. Quantitation of viral loads using the crossover (Ct) value of real-time RT-PCR correlated with the duration of symptoms. More than half of both primary and secondary dengue cases were hospitalised. There was no dengue-related mortality in this study. CONCLUSION: The duration of illness and prolonged symptom duration in 9% of the subjects indicate that the burden of dengue illness is substantially different from other non-dengue febrile illness in our study cohort. Our study also highlights the paucity of early prognostic markers for dengue fever in adults.

15518806,2004 Nov 24,Markedly reduced severity of Dengue virus infection in mosquito cell cultures persistently infected with Aedes albopictus densovirus (AalDNV).,"AalDNV-infected C6/36 cells serially passaged for over 10 weeks showed a decline in percentage of anti-AalDNV-positive cells (APC) from an initial 92% to approximately 20%. Cultures of persistent APC were indistinguishable from uninfected cultures by direct microscopy but most stained cells from early APC passages had enlarged nuclei with eosinophilic inclusions, while late APC passages had few and naive cells none. Super challenge of persistent APC cultures did not increase percentage APC and supernatants from persistent APC cultures gave low APC (40%) in naive C6/36 cell cultures. When challenged with dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2), naive C6/36 cells showed severe cytopathic effects (CPE) and high mortality within 4 days, as did early passage APC cultures. Remarkably, DEN-2 infections in persistent APC cultures were much less severe, being characterized by reduced DEN-2 infection percentage, retarded DEN-2 virion production, no CPE and no significant mortality. Reasons for rapid reduction in APC and resistance to superinfection upon serial passage remain unproven but may relate to production of AalDNV-defective interfering particles (DIP) by molecular mechanisms still open to speculation. More difficult to explain is cross-protection against DEN-2-induced mortality seen in persistent APC cultures. However, by comparison to work on shrimp viruses, we speculate that this may involve blockage of viral-triggered apoptosis. The phenomena described raise questions regarding the potential for persistent infections by unknown viruses to confound experimental results with insect cell lines.

34931940,2022 Dec,Generation and characterization of genetically and antigenically diverse infectious clones of dengue virus serotypes 1-4.,"Dengue is caused by four genetically distinct viral serotypes, dengue virus (DENV) 1-4. Following transmission by Aedes mosquitoes, DENV can cause a broad spectrum of clinically apparent disease ranging from febrile illness to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Progress in the understanding of different dengue serotypes and their impacts on specific host-virus interactions has been hampered by the scarcity of tools that adequately reflect their antigenic and genetic diversity. To bridge this gap, we created and characterized infectious clones of DENV1-4 originating from South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Analysis of whole viral genome sequences of five DENV isolates from each of the four serotypes confirmed their broad genetic and antigenic diversity. Using a modified circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER), we generated de novo viruses from these isolates. The resultant clones replicated robustly in human and insect cells at levels similar to those of the parental strains. To investigate in vivo properties of these genetically diverse isolates, representative viruses from each DENV serotype were administered to NOD Rag1(-/-), IL2rg(null) Flk2(-/-) (NRGF) mice, engrafted with components of a human immune system. All DENV strains tested resulted in viremia in humanized mice and induced cellular and IgM immune responses. Collectively, we describe here a workflow for rapidly generating de novo infectious clones of DENV - and conceivably other RNA viruses. The infectious clones described here are a valuable resource for reverse genetic studies and for characterizing host responses to DENV in vitro and in vivo. Princeton, NJ, USA.

30235208,2018 Sep,Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of dengue viruses imported into Taiwan during 2011-2016.,"A total of 1,596 laboratory-confirmed imported dengue cases were identified in Taiwan during 2011-2016. Most of the imported cases arrived from Southeast Asia as well as the Indian subcontinent, the Pacific region, Latin America, Australia and Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of the complete envelope protein gene sequences from 784 imported dengue virus (DENV) isolates were conducted, and the results suggest that the DENV-1 genotype I and DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype comprise the predominant serotype/genotype of DENV strains circulating in Southeast Asia. The DENV-1 genotype III, DENV-3 genotype III and DENV-4 genotype I and II strains were found to be newly emerging in several Southeast Asian countries. Our results also showed that geographical restrictions of DENV-1 genotype I, DENV-1 genotype III and DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype are becoming blurred, indicating the extensive introductions and continuous expansions of DENV strains between nations in Southeast Asia. In this study, we present the geographic distribution and dynamic transmission of DENV strains circulating in Southeast Asian countries. In addition, we demonstrated local dengue epidemics caused by several imported DENV strains in Taiwan during 2011-2016. Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan, Republic of China.

29672522,2018 Apr,Nucleobases and corresponding nucleosides display potent antiviral activities against dengue virus possibly through viral lethal mutagenesis.,"Dengue virus affects millions of people worldwide each year. To date, there is no drug for the treatment of dengue-associated disease. Nucleosides are effective antivirals and work by inhibiting the accurate replication of the viral genome. Nucleobases offer a cheaper alternative to nucleosides for broad antiviral applications. Metabolic activation of nucleobases involves condensation with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to give the corresponding nucleoside-5'-monophosphate. This could provide an alternative to phosphorylation of a nucleoside, a step that is often rate limiting and inefficient in activation of nucleosides. We evaluated more than 30 nucleobases and corresponding nucleosides for their antiviral activity against dengue virus. Five nucleobases and two nucleosides were found to induce potent antiviral effects not previously described. Our studies further revealed that nucleobases were usually more active with a better tissue culture therapeutic index than their corresponding nucleosides. The development of viral lethal mutagenesis, an antiviral approach that takes into account the quasispecies behavior of RNA viruses, represents an exciting prospect not yet studied in the context of dengue replication. Passage of the virus in the presence of the nucleobase 3a (T-1105) and corresponding nucleoside 3b (T-1106), favipiravir derivatives, induced an increase in apparent mutations, indicating lethal mutagenesis as a possible antiviral mechanism. A more concerted and widespread screening of nucleobase libraries is a very promising approach to identify dengue virus inhibitors including those that may act as viral mutagens.

26581295,2015 Nov 19,"El Niño-Southern Oscillation, local weather and occurrences of dengue virus serotypes.","Severe dengue fever is usually associated with secondary infection by a dengue virus (DENV) serotype (1 to 4) that is different to the serotype of the primary infection. Dengue outbreaks only occur following importations of DENV in Cairns, Australia. However, the majority of imported cases do not result in autochthonous transmission in Cairns. Although DENV transmission is strongly associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate cycle and local weather conditions, the frequency and potential risk factors of infections with the different DENV serotypes, including whether or not they differ, is unknown. This study used a classification tree model to identify the hierarchical interactions between Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), local weather factors, the presence of imported serotypes and the occurrence of the four autochthonous DENV serotypes from January 2000-December 2009 in Cairns. We found that the 12-week moving average of SOI and the 2-week moving average of maximum temperature were the most important factors influencing the variation in the weekly occurrence of the four DENV serotypes, the likelihoods of the occurrence of the four DENV serotypes may be unequal under the same environmental conditions, and occurrence may be influenced by changes in global and local environmental conditions in Cairns.

33239063,2020 Nov 25,"Surveillance of dengue virus in individual Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected concurrently with suspected human cases in Tarlac City, Philippines.","BACKGROUND: Vector control measures are critical for the prevention and reduction of dengue virus (DENV) transmission. Effective vector control is reliant not only on knowledge of mosquito abundance, but also on the timely and accurate detection of mosquito-borne infection. Mosquito-based virus surveillance programs typically rely on pool-based mosquito testing, although whether individual-based mosquito testing is a feasible alternative to this has not been widely studied. Applying an individual-based mosquito testing approach, we conducted a 1-month surveillance study of DENV in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in homes of suspected dengue patients during the 2015 peak dengue season in Tarlac City, Philippines to more accurately assess the mosquito infection rate and identify the DENV serotypes and genotypes concurrently co-circulating in mosquitoes and patients there. METHODS: We performed a one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV in patients and individual female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Additionally, we performed sequencing and phylogenetic analyses to further characterize the detected DENV serotypes in mosquitoes and patients at the genotype level. RESULTS: We collected a total of 583 adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, of which we individually tested 359 female mosquitoes for the presence of DENV. Ten (2.8%) of the 359 female mosquitoes were positive for the presence of DENV. We detected DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 in the field-collected mosquitoes, which was consistent with the serotypes concurrently found in infected patients. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the detected DENV serotypes based on the partial sequence of the evelope (E) gene revealed three genotypes concurrently present in the sampled mosquitoes and patients during the study period, namely DENV-1 genotype IV, DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype, and DENV-4 genotype II. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the utility of a one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the individual-based DENV surveillance of mosquitoes. Our findings reinforce the importance of detecting and monitoring virus activity in local mosquito populations, which are critical for dengue prevention and control. Ehime, Japan. Japan.

26010246,2015,A Highly Sensitive Diagnostic System for Detecting Dengue Viruses Using the Interaction between a Sulfated Sugar Chain and a Virion.,"We propose a novel method of detecting trace amounts of dengue virus (DENVs) from serum. Our method is based on the interaction between a sulfated sugar chain and a DENV surface glycoprotein. After capturing DENV with the sulfated sugar chain-immobilized gold nanoparticles (SGNPs), the resulting complex is precipitated and viral RNA content is measured using the reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction SYBR Green I (RT-qPCR-Syb) method. Sugar chains that bind to DENVs were identified using the array-type sugar chain immobilized chip (Sugar Chip) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. Heparin and low-molecular-weight dextran sulfate were identified as binding partners, and immobilized on gold nanoparticles to prepare 3 types of SGNPs. The capacity of these SGNPs to capture and concentrate trace amounts of DENVs was evaluated in vitro. The SGNP with greatest sensitivity was tested using clinical samples in Indonesia in 2013-2014. As a result, the novel method was able to detect low concentrations of DENVs using only 6 μL of serum, with similar sensitivity to that of a Qiagen RNA extraction kit using 140 μL of serum. In addition, this method allows for multiplex-like identification of serotypes of DENVs. This feature is important for good healthcare management of DENV infection in order to safely diagnose the dangerous, highly contagious disease quickly, with high sensitivity.

32640225,2020 Jul 7,A Non-Replicative Role of the 3' Terminal Sequence of the Dengue Virus Genome in Membranous Replication Organelle Formation.,"Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), members of the Flavivirus genus, rearrange endoplasmic reticulum membranes to induce invaginations known as vesicle packets (VPs), which are the assumed sites for viral RNA replication. Mechanistic information on VP biogenesis has so far been difficult to attain due to the necessity of studying their formation under conditions of viral replication, where perturbations reducing replication will inevitably impact VP formation. Here, we report a replication-independent expression system, designated pIRO (plasmid-induced replication organelle formation) that induces bona fide DENV and ZIKV VPs that are morphologically indistinguishable from those in infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate that sequences in the 3' terminal RNA region of the DENV, but not the ZIKV genome, contribute to VP formation in a non-replicative manner. These results validate the pIRO system that opens avenues for mechanistically dissecting virus replication from membrane reorganization. Heidelberg, Germany. Heidelberg, Germany. Heidelberg, Germany.

24625456,2014 Mar,Dengue virus type 2 (DENV2)-induced oxidative responses in monocytes from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient and G6PD normal subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus is endemic in peninsular Malaysia. The clinical manifestations vary depending on the incubation period of the virus as well as the immunity of the patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Malaysia where the incidence is 3.2%. It has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. In this study, we aim to investigate the oxidative responses of DENV2-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals. METHODOLOGY: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals were infected with DENV2 and infection rate, levels of oxidative species, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anions (O2-), and oxidative stress were determined and compared with normal controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals exhibited significantly higher infection rates compared to normal controls. In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O2- in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O2- were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altered redox state of DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals appears to augment viral replication in these cells. DENV-infected G6PD-deficient individuals may contain higher viral titers, which may be significant in enhanced virus transmission. Furthermore, granulocyte dysfunction and higher viral loads in G6PD-deificient individuals may result in severe form of dengue infection. Malaysia. Malaysia. Malaysia.

20808806,2010 Aug 23,The effects of tertiary and quaternary infections on the epidemiology of dengue.,"The epidemiology of dengue is characterised by irregular epidemic outbreaks and desynchronised dynamics of its four co-circulating virus serotypes. Whilst infection by one serotype appears to convey life-long protection to homologous infection, it is believed to be a risk factor for severe disease manifestations upon secondary, heterologous infection due to the phenomenon of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Subsequent clinical infections are rarely reported and, since the majority of dengue infections are generally asymptomatic, it is not clear if and to what degree tertiary or quaternary infections contribute to dengue epidemiology. Here we investigate the effect of third and subsequent infections on the transmission dynamics of dengue and show that although the qualitative patterns are largely equivalent, the system more readily exhibits the desynchronised serotype oscillations and multi-annual epidemic outbreaks upon their inclusion. More importantly, permitting third and fourth infections significantly increases the force of infection without resorting to high basic reproductive numbers. Realistic age-prevalent patterns and seroconversion rates are therefore easier reconciled with a low value of dengue's transmission potential if allowing for more than two infections; this should have important consequences for dengue control and intervention measures.","['Age Distribution', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Models, Biological', 'Severe Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Time Factors']","['The epidemiology of dengue is characterised by irregular epidemic outbreaks and desynchronised dynamics of its four co-circulating virus serotypes.', 'Whilst infection by one serotype appears to convey life-long protection to homologous infection, it is believed to be a risk factor for severe disease manifestations upon secondary, heterologous infection due to the phenomenon of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE).', 'Subsequent clinical infections are rarely reported and, since the majority of dengue infections are generally asymptomatic, it is not clear if and to what degree tertiary or quaternary infections contribute to dengue epidemiology.', 'Here we investigate the effect of third and subsequent infections on the transmission dynamics of dengue and show that although the qualitative patterns are largely equivalent, the system more readily exhibits the desynchronised serotype oscillations and multi-annual epidemic outbreaks upon their inclusion.', 'More importantly, permitting third and fourth infections significantly increases the force of infection without resorting to high basic reproductive numbers.', ""Realistic age-prevalent patterns and seroconversion rates are therefore easier reconciled with a low value of dengue's transmission potential if allowing for more than two infections; this should have important consequences for dengue control and intervention measures.""]"
22130539,2012 Feb,Dengue-1 virus clade replacement in Thailand associated with enhanced mosquito transmission.,"Dengue viruses (DENV) are characterized by extensive genetic diversity and can be organized in multiple, genetically distinct lineages that arise and die out on a regular basis in regions where dengue is endemic. A fundamental question for understanding DENV evolution is the relative extent to which stochastic processes (genetic drift) and natural selection acting on fitness differences among lineages contribute to lineage diversity and turnover. Here, we used a set of recently collected and archived low-passage DENV-1 isolates from Thailand to examine the role of mosquito vector-virus interactions in DENV evolution. By comparing the ability of 23 viruses isolated on different dates between 1985 and 2009 to be transmitted by a present-day Aedes aegypti population from Thailand, we found that a major clade replacement event in the mid-1990s was associated with virus isolates exhibiting increased titers in the vector's hemocoel, which is predicted to result in a higher probability of transmission. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection for enhanced transmission by mosquitoes is a possible mechanism underlying major DENV clade replacement events. There was significant variation in transmission potential among isolates within each clade, indicating that in addition to vector-driven selection, other evolutionary forces act to maintain viral genetic diversity. We conclude that occasional adaptive processes involving the mosquito vector can drive major DENV lineage replacement events. louis.lambrechts@pasteur.fr","['Aedes/*virology', 'Animals', 'Dengue/*transmission', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*pathogenicity', '*Insect Vectors', 'Phylogeny', 'Probability', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Thailand']","['Dengue viruses (DENV) are characterized by extensive genetic diversity and can be organized in multiple, genetically distinct lineages that arise and die out on a regular basis in regions where dengue is endemic.', 'A fundamental question for understanding DENV evolution is the relative extent to which stochastic processes (genetic drift) and natural selection acting on fitness differences among lineages contribute to lineage diversity and turnover.', 'Here, we used a set of recently collected and archived low-passage DENV-1 isolates from Thailand to examine the role of mosquito vector-virus interactions in DENV evolution.', ""By comparing the ability of 23 viruses isolated on different dates between 1985 and 2009 to be transmitted by a present-day Aedes aegypti population from Thailand, we found that a major clade replacement event in the mid-1990s was associated with virus isolates exhibiting increased titers in the vector's hemocoel, which is predicted to result in a higher probability of transmission."", 'This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection for enhanced transmission by mosquitoes is a possible mechanism underlying major DENV clade replacement events.', 'There was significant variation in transmission potential among isolates within each clade, indicating that in addition to vector-driven selection, other evolutionary forces act to maintain viral genetic diversity.', 'We conclude that occasional adaptive processes involving the mosquito vector can drive major DENV lineage replacement events.', 'louis.lambrechts@pasteur.fr']"
23041731,2012 Sep,Dengue in India.,"Dengue virus belongs to family Flaviviridae, having four serotypes that spread by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. It causes a wide spectrum of illness from mild asymptomatic illness to severe fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-risk regions with about 100 million new cases each year worldwide. The cumulative dengue diseases burden has attained an unprecedented proportion in recent times with sharp increase in the size of human population at risk. Dengue disease presents highly complex pathophysiological, economic and ecologic problems. In India, the first epidemic of clinical dengue-like illness was recorded in Madras (now Chennai) in 1780 and the first virologically proved epidemic of dengue fever (DF) occurred in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Eastern Coast of India in 1963-1964. During the last 50 years a large number of physicians have treated and described dengue disease in India, but the scientific studies addressing various problems of dengue disease have been carried out at limited number of centres.

35632682,2022 Apr 29,Molecular Characterization and Identification of Potential Inhibitors for 'E' Protein of Dengue Virus.,"Dengue is an arthropod-borne acute febrile illness caused by Dengue Virus (DENV), a member of Flaviviridae. Severity of the infection ranges from mild self-limiting illness to severe life-threatening hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). To date, there is no specific antiviral therapy established to treat the infection. The current study reports the epidemiology of DENV infections and potential inhibitors of DENV 'E' protein. Among the various serotypes, DENV-2 serotype was observed more frequently, followed by DENV-4, DENV-1, and DENV-3. New variants of existing genotypes were observed in DENV-1, 2, and 4 serotypes. Predominantly, the severe form of dengue was attributable to DENV-2 infections, and the incidence was more common in males and pediatric populations. Both the incidence and the disease severity were more common among the residents of non-urban environments. Due to the predominantly self-limiting nature of primary dengue infection and folk medicine practices of non-urban populations, we observed a greater number of secondary dengue cases than primary dengue cases. Hemorrhagic manifestations were more in secondary dengue in particularly in the pediatric group. Through different computational methods, ligands RGBLD1, RGBLD2, RGBLD3, and RGBLD4 are proposed as potential inhibitors in silico against DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 serotypes.

28327173,2017 Mar 21,A new paradigm for Aedes spp. surveillance using gravid ovipositing sticky trap and NS1 antigen test kit.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue remains a serious public health problem in Southeast Asia and has increased 37-fold in Malaysia compared to decades ago. New strategies are urgently needed for early detection and control of dengue epidemics. METHODS: We conducted a two year study in a high human density dengue-endemic urban area in Selangor, where Gravid Ovipositing Sticky (GOS) traps were set up to capture adult Aedes spp. mosquitoes. All Aedes mosquitoes were tested using the NS1 dengue antigen test kit. All dengue cases from the study site notified to the State Health Department were recorded. Weekly microclimatic temperature, relative humidity (RH) and rainfall were monitored. RESULTS: Aedes aegypti was the predominant mosquito (95.6%) caught in GOS traps and 23% (43/187 pools of 5 mosquitoes each) were found to be positive for dengue using the NS1 antigen kit. Confirmed cases of dengue were observed with a lag of one week after positive Ae. aegypti were detected. Aedes aegypti density as analysed by distributed lag non-linear models, will increase lag of 2-3 weeks for temperature increase from 28 to 30 °C; and lag of three weeks for increased rainfall.

27784988,2016,Looking for inhibitors of the dengue virus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase using a molecular docking approach.,"The dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains both an N-terminal methyltransferase domain and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. Polymerase activity is responsible for viral RNA synthesis by a de novo initiation mechanism and represents an attractive target for antiviral therapy. The incidence of DENV has grown rapidly and it is now estimated that half of the human population is at risk of becoming infected with this virus. Despite this, there are no effective drugs to treat DENV infections. The present in silico study aimed at finding new inhibitors of the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the four serotypes of DENV. We used a chemical library comprising 372,792 nonnucleotide compounds (around 325,319 natural compounds) to perform molecular docking experiments against a binding site of the RNA template tunnel of the virus polymerase. Compounds with high negative free energy variation (ΔG <-10.5 kcal/mol) were selected as putative inhibitors. Additional filters for favorable druggability and good absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity were applied. Finally, after the screening process was completed, we identified 39 compounds as lead DENV polymerase inhibitor candidates. Potentially, these compounds could act as efficient DENV polymerase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Elche, Spain.

We found that siRNA mediated knock down of mevalonate diphospho decarboxylase (MVD) inhibited viral replication of the Rluc-replicon and DEN-2 NGC live virus replication in A549 cells. When the Rluc-replicon A459 cells were grown in delipidated media the replicon expression was suppressed and MVD knock down could further sensitize Renilla expression. Hymeglusin and zaragozic acid A could inhibit DEN-2 NGC live virus replication in K562 cells, while lovastatin could inhibit DEN-2 NGC live virus replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Renilla expression could be rescued in fluvastatin treated A549 Rluc-replicon cells after the addition of mevalonate, and partially restored with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, or farnesyl pyrophosphate.

17573132,2007 Oct,Single-tube nested PCR using immobilized internal primers for the identification of dengue virus serotypes.,"Molecular techniques based on the detection of genomic sequences by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, nested PCR, or real-time PCR have made possible the rapid diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infections, and these approaches have been accepted by clinical laboratories as the new standard method for the detection of dengue virus in acute-phase serum samples. One of these PCR-based assays, the two-step RT nested PCR (RT-NPCR) technique is used routinely in laboratories worldwide. In the present study, the two-step RT-NPCR as described by Lanciotti et al.

28381578,2017 Jun 15,Mutagenesis of Dengue Virus Protein NS2A Revealed a Novel Domain Responsible for Virus-Induced Cytopathic Effect and Interactions between NS2A and NS2B Transmembrane Segments.,"The NS2A protein of dengue virus (DENV) has eight predicted transmembrane segments (pTMS1 to -8) and participates in RNA replication, virion assembly, and host antiviral response. However, the roles of specific amino acid residues within the pTMS regions of NS2A during the viral life cycle are not clear. Here, we explore the function of DENV NS2A by introducing a series of alanine substitutions into the N-terminal half (pTMS1 to -4) of the protein in the context of a DENV infectious clone or subgenomic replicon. Six NS2A mutants (NM5, -7, -9, and -17 to -19) around pTMS1 and -2 displayed a novel phenotype showing a >1,000-fold reduction in virus yield, an absence of plaque formation despite wild-type-like replicon activity, and infectious-virus-like particle yields. HEK-293 cells infected with the six NS2A mutant viruses failed to cause a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by MitoCapture staining, cell proliferation, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. Sequencing analyses of pseudorevertant viruses derived from lethal-mutant viruses revealed two consensus reversion mutations, leucine to phenylalanine at codon 181 (L181F) within pTMS7 of NS2A and isoleucine to threonine at codon 114 (I114T) within NS2B. The introduction of an NS2A-L181F mutation into the lethal (NM15, -16, -25, and -33) and CPE-defective (NM7, -9, and -19) mutants substantially rescued virus infectivity and virus-induced CPE, respectively, whereas the NS2B-L114T mutation rescued the NM16, -25, and -33 mutants. In conclusion, the results revealed the essential roles of the N-terminal half of NS2A in RNA replication and virus-induced CPE. Intramolecular interactions between pTMSs of NS2A and intermolecular interactions between the NS2A and NS2B proteins were also implicated.IMPORTANCE The characterization of the N-terminal (current study) and C-terminal halves of DENV NS2A is the most comprehensive mutagenesis study to date to investigate the function of NS2A during the flaviviral life cycle. A novel region responsible for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) within pTMS1 and -2 of DENV NS2A was identified. Revertant genetics studies implied unexpected relationships between various pTMSs of DENV NS2A and NS2B. These results provide comprehensive information regarding the functions of DENV NS2A and the specific amino acids and transmembrane segments responsible for these functions. The positions and properties of the rescuing mutations were also revealed, providing important clues regarding the manner in which intramolecular or intermolecular interactions between the pTMSs of NS2A and NS2B regulate virus replication, assembly/secretion, and virus-induced CPE. These results expand the understanding of flavivirus replication. The knowledge may also facilitate studies of pathogenesis and novel vaccine and antiflaviviral drug development.

8648730,1996 Jun,Dengue type 4 virus mutants containing deletions in the 3' noncoding region of the RNA genome: analysis of growth restriction in cell culture and altered viremia pattern and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys.,"The dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) genome contains a 384-nucleotide (nt) 3' noncoding sequence in which the last 81 nt, predicted to form a secondary structure, are thought to be essential for virus replication. Immediately upstream of the secondary structure, short RNA sequences that are conserved among mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been identified. A series of deletions that range from 30 to 262 nt were introduced into this upstream region of full-length DEN4 cDNA to create viable deletion mutants, some of which might prove to be useful for inclusion in a live attenuated virus vaccine. When studied by an infectious-center assay, most full-length RNA transcripts of the deletion constructs exhibited reduced infectivity when transfected into simian LLC-MK2 cells compared with the full-length RNA transcripts of wild-type parental virus. Deletion mutations that extended as far as the 5' boundary of the 3' noncoding region and whose 3' boundary did not extend beyond the last 113 nt of the 3' end were viable. With the exception of mutant 3'd 303-183, which contained a deletion of nt 303 to 183 from the 3' terminus, deletion mutants produced plaques that appeared late on simian LLC-MK2 cells or exhibited a small-plaque morphology on mosquito C6/36 cells compared with the wild-type virus. These mutants also replicated less efficiently and attained a lower titer in LLC-MK2 cells than parental wild-type virus. Significantly, mutant 3'd 303-183 grew to a high titer and was least restricted in growth. Mutant 3'd 303-183 and four other moderately to severely restricted mutants were selected for evaluation of infectivity and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys. There was a suggestion that occurrence and duration of viremia were reduced for some of the deletion mutants compared with the wild-type virus. However, more convincing evidence for attenuation of some of the mutants was provided by an analysis of antibody response to infection. Mutant 3'd 303-183 induced an antibody response equivalent to that stimulated by wild-type virus, whereas other mutants induced low to moderate levels of antibodies, as measured by radioimmunoprecipitation and virus neutralization. The immunogenicity of these 3' DEN4 deletion mutants in monkeys appeared to correlate with their efficiency of growth in simian LLC-MK2 cells.

METHODS: We used the national data on annual reported cases, deaths, incidence rate, mortality rate, and case fatality rate of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) as well as dengue virus serotypes prevalent in Malaysia during the last decade. Trend/ regression lines were fitted to investigate the trend of dengue incidences and deaths due to the disease for a 11-year period (2000-2010). For the distribution of national incidence rate, mortality rate, and case fatality rate of DF and DHF, descriptive statistics using mean and 95% confidence intervals (CI 39) for means, and range were applied. RESULTS: The number of dengue cases and number of deaths have increased, on average, by 14% and 8% per year respectively. The average annual incidence rate of DF per 100 000 populations was higher as compared to that of DHF. Conversely, the yearly mean mortality rate of DHF per 100 000 populations was greater than that of DF. The simultaneous circulation of all four dengue serotypes has been found in Malaysia. But a particular dengue virus serotype predominates for at least two years before it becomes replaced by another serotype.

During a screen for potential application to mosquito transmitted viruses, BBR was shown to have virucidal activity against dengue virus (DENV; IC(50) 42.87 µM) as well as against Zika virus (IC(50) 11.42 µM) and chikungunya virus (IC(50) 14.21 µM). BBR was shown to have cellular effects that lead to an increase in cellular DENV E protein without a concomitant effect on DENV nonstructural proteins, suggesting an effect on viral particle formation or egress. While BBR was shown to have an effect of ERK1/2 activation this did not result in defects in viral egress mechanisms. The primary effect of BBR on viral production was likely to be through BBR acting through AMPK activation and disruption of lipid metabolism. Combined these results suggest that BBR has a dual effect on DENV infection, and BBR may have the potential for development as an anti-DENV antiviral. Thailand.

36739680,2023 Mar,Development of novel antiviral peptides against dengue serotypes 1-4.,"Dengue infections pose a critical threat to public health worldwide. Since there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs to treat dengue infections caused by the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, there is an urgent need to develop effective antivirals. Peptides are promising antiviral candidates due to their specificity and non-toxic properties. The DENV envelope (E) protein was selected for the design of antiviral peptides due to its importance in receptor binding and viral fusion to the host cell membrane. Twelve novel peptides were designed to mimic regions containing critical amino acid residues of the DENV E protein required for interaction with the host. A total of four peptides were identified to exhibit potent inhibitory effects against at least three or all four DENV serotypes. Peptide 3 demonstrated all three modes of action: cell protection and inhibition of post-infection against all four DENV serotypes, whereas direct virus-inactivating effects were only observed against DENV-2, 3, and 4. Peptide 4 showed good direct virus-inactivating effects against DENV-2 (74.26%) as well as good inhibitions of DENV-1 (80.37%) and DENV-4 (72.22%) during the post-infection stage. Peptide 5 exhibited direct virus-inactivating effects against all four DENV serotypes, albeit at lower inhibition levels against DENV-1 and DENV-3. It also exhibited highly significant inhibition of DENV-4 (89.31%) during post-infection. Truncated peptide 5F which was derived from peptide 5 showed more significant inhibition of DENV-4 (91.58%) during post-infection and good direct virus-inactivating effects against DENV-2 (77.55%) at a lower concentration of 100 μM. Peptide 3 could be considered as the best antiviral candidate for pre- and post-infection treatments of DENV infections in regions with four circulating dengue serotypes. However, if the most predominant dengue serotype for a particular region could be identified, peptides with significantly high antiviral activities against that particular dengue serotype could serve as more suitable antiviral candidates. Thus, peptide 5F serves as a more suitable antiviral candidate for post-infection treatment against DENV-4. Sunway University, 5, Jalan Universiti, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, 47500, Malaysia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All physician-diagnosed, laboratory-confirmed cases of DF/DHF notified to the Ministry of Health, Singapore during the outbreak as well as entomological and virological data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 14,006 cases of DF/DHF comprising 13,625 cases of DF and 381 cases of DHF, including 27 deaths were reported, giving an incidence rate of 322.6 per 100,000 and a case-fatality rate of 0.19%. The median age of the cases and deaths were 32 and 59.5 years, respectively. The incidence rate of those living in compound houses was more than twice that of residents living in public and private apartments. The distribution of DF/DHF cases was more closely associated with Aedes aegypti compared to Aedes albopictus breeding sites and the overall Aedes premises index was 1.15% (2.28% in compound houses and 0.33% to 0.8% in public and private apartments). The predominant dengue serotype was DEN-1. A significant correlation between weekly mean temperature and cases was noted. The correlation was strongest when the increase in temperature preceded rise in cases by a period of 18 weeks. CONCLUSION: The resurgence occurred in a highly densely populated city-state in the presence of low Aedes mosquito population. Factors contributing to this resurgence included lower herd immunity and change in dominant dengue serotype from DEN-2 to DEN-1. There was no evidence from gene sequencing of the dengue viruses that the epidemic was precipitated by the introduction of a new virulent strain. The current epidemiological situation is highly conducive to periodic dengue recurrences. A high degree of vigilance and active community participation in source reduction should be maintained.

18495513,2008 Sep,Emergence of an independent lineage of dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) and its co-circulation with predominant DENV-3 during the 2006 dengue fever outbreak in Delhi.,"OBJECTIVES: The sudden emergence of dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) and its co-circulation with predominant DENV-3 was the hallmark of the 2006 dengue fever outbreak in Delhi. Viruses that circulated between 1996 and 2005 in the City have been well characterized, but the genomic diversity in 2006 strains is not known. The present study was undertaken to reveal the emerging molecular genotype(s) and evolutionary trend of the viruses responsible for the dengue fever outbreak in Delhi during 2006. STUDY DESIGN: The CprM gene junction of the DENV isolates from the 2006 Delhi dengue fever outbreak were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Comparative phylogenetic analysis was done using DENV-1 and DENV-3 sequences retrieved from the global database. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment revealed only substitutions, with no insertions or deletions. A dendrogram indicated emergence of a distinct lineage of DENV-1 (having similarity with the Comoros/Singapore 1993 and Delhi 1982 strains, but quite different from the Delhi 2005 lineage) and microevolution of the pre-circulating DENV-3. These findings point towards the circulation of two independent lineages of DENV-1 in Delhi during 2005 and 2006. CONCLUSIONS: It is feared that the introduction of an independent lineage of the outbreak-associated strain of DENV-1 and its co-circulation with the deeply-rooted strain of DENV-3 in Delhi may result in yet another, possibly more severe outbreak in the near future.

26658730,2015 Dec,"Epidemiology of Infant Dengue Cases Illuminates Serotype-Specificity in the Interaction between Immunity and Disease, and Changes in Transmission Dynamics.","BACKGROUND: Infants born to dengue immune mothers acquire maternal antibodies to dengue. These antibodies, though initially protective, decline during the first year of life to levels thought to be disease enhancing, before reaching undetectable levels. Infants have long been studied to understand the interaction between infection and disease on an individual level. METHODS/FINDINGS: Considering infants (cases <1 year old) as a unique group, we analyzed serotype specific dengue case data from patients admitted to a pediatric hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. We show differences in the propensity of serotypes to cause disease in individuals with dengue antibodies (infants and post-primary cases) and in individuals without dengue antibodies (primary cases). The mean age of infant cases differed among serotypes, consistent with previously observed differential waning of maternal antibody titers by serotype. We show that trends over time in epidemiology of infant cases are consistent with those observed in the whole population, and therefore with trends in the force of infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Infants with dengue are informative about the interaction between antibody and the dengue serotypes, confirming that in this population DENV-2 and DENV-4 almost exclusively cause disease in the presence of dengue antibody despite infections occurring in others. We also observe differences between the serotypes in the mean age in infant cases, informative about the interaction between waning immunity and disease for the different serotypes in infants. In addition, we show that the mean age of infant cases over time is informative about transmission in the whole population. Therefore, ongoing surveillance for dengue in infants could provide useful insights into dengue epidemiology, particularly after the introduction of a dengue vaccine targeting adults and older children.

30044715,2018 Sep 29,"The Good, the Bad, and the Shocking: The Multiple Roles of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 in Protection and Pathogenesis.","Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent medically important mosquito-borne virus in the world. Upon DENV infection of a host cell, DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can be found intracellularly as a monomer, associated with the cell surface as a dimer, and secreted as a hexamer into the bloodstream. NS1 plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle, particularly in RNA replication and immune evasion of the complement pathway. Over the past several years, key roles for NS1 in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease have emerged, including direct action of the protein on the vascular endothelium and triggering release of vasoactive cytokines from immune cells, both of which result in endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. Importantly, the adaptive immune response generates a robust response against NS1, and its potential contribution to dengue vaccines is also discussed.

15932883,2005 Aug 5,Functional profiling of recombinant NS3 proteases from all four serotypes of dengue virus using tetrapeptide and octapeptide substrate libraries.,"Regulated proteolysis by the two-component NS2B/NS3 protease of dengue virus is essential for virus replication and the maturation of infectious virions. The functional similarity between the NS2B/NS3 proteases from the four genetically and antigenically distinct serotypes was addressed by characterizing the differences in their substrate specificity using tetrapeptide and octapeptide libraries in a positional scanning format, each containing 130,321 substrates. The proteases from different serotypes were shown to be functionally homologous based on the similarity of their substrate cleavage preferences. A strong preference for basic amino acid residues (Arg/Lys) at the P1 positions was observed, whereas the preferences for the P2-4 sites were in the order of Arg > Thr > Gln/Asn/Lys for P2, Lys > Arg > Asn for P3, and Nle > Leu > Lys > Xaa for P4. The prime site substrate specificity was for small and polar amino acids in P1' and P3'. In contrast, the P2' and P4' substrate positions showed minimal activity. The influence of the P2 and P3 amino acids on ground state binding and the P4 position for transition state stabilization was identified through single substrate kinetics with optimal and suboptimal substrate sequences.

31243722,2019 Jul,Increased serum ferritin and interleukin-18 levels in children with dengue.,"Activated monocytes/macrophages that produce a cytokine storm play an important role in the pathogenesis of dengue. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by monocyte/macrophages that is increased during dengue. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and expressed by cells of the reticulo-endothelial system in response to infection by dengue virus. The aims of this study were to analyze the simultaneous expression of both IL-18 and ferritins in children infected by diverse serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and determine their association with dengue severity. In this regard, children with dengue (n = 25) and healthy controls with similar age and sex (n = 20) were analyzed for circulating ferritin and cytokines. Monocytes were isolated by Hystopaque gradient and co-cultured with DENV-2. IL-18 and ferritin contents in blood, and IL-18 in culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. Increased levels of ferritin and IL-18 (p < 0.0001) were observed in dengue patients, not associated to NS1expression or type of infection (primary or secondary). Highest values of both molecules (p < 0.001) were observed in dengue with warning signs and severe dengue. Differential effect on IL-18/ferritin production was observed associated to viral serotype infection. There were no correlations between ferritin vs. IL-18 production, ferritin vs. NS1 status, and IL-18 vs. NS1 status. Viral-infected monocyte cultures showed increased production of IL-18 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, increased circulating ferritin and IL-18 are expressed in children infected by different serotypes of DENV associated with dengue severity.

35062224,2021 Dec 23,Dengue Infection Susceptibility of Five Aedes aegypti Populations from Manaus (Brazil) after Challenge with Virus Serotypes 1-4.,"The successful spread and maintenance of the dengue virus (DENV) in mosquito vectors depends on their viral infection susceptibility, and parameters related to vector competence are the most valuable for measuring the risk of viral transmission by mosquitoes. These parameters may vary according to the viral serotype in circulation and in accordance with the geographic origin of the mosquito population that is being assessed. In this study, we investigated the effect of DENV serotypes (1-4) with regards to the infection susceptibility of five Brazilian Ae. aegypti populations from Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Mosquitoes were challenged by oral infection with the DENV serotypes and then tested for the presence of the arbovirus using quantitative PCR at 14 days post-infection, which is the time point that corresponds to the extrinsic incubation period of Ae. aegypti when reared at 28 °C. Thus, we were able to determine the infection patterns for DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 in the mosquito populations. The mosquitoes had both interpopulation and inter-serotype variation in their viral susceptibilities. All DENV serotypes showed a similar tendency to accumulate in the body in a greater amount than in the head/salivary gland (head/SG), which does not occur with other flaviviruses. For DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4, the body viral load varied among populations, but the head/SG viral loads were similar. Differently for DENV-2, both body and head/SG viral loads varied among populations. As the lack of phenotypic homogeneity represents one of the most important reasons for the long-term fight against dengue incidence, we expect that this study will help us to understand the dynamics of the infection patterns that are triggered by the distinct serotypes of DENV in mosquitoes.

26381649,2015,"Inferring Protective CD8+ T-Cell Epitopes for NS5 Protein of Four Serotypes of Dengue Virus Chinese Isolates Based on HLA-A, -B and -C Allelic Distribution: Implications for Epitope-Based Universal Vaccine Design.","Dengue is one of the most globally serious vector-borne infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical areas for which there are currently no effective vaccines. The most highly conserved flavivirus protein, NS5, is an indispensable target of CD8+ T-cells, making it an ideal vaccine design target. Using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), CD8+ T-cell epitopes of the dengue virus (DENV) NS5 protein were predicted by genotypic frequency of the HLA-A,-B, and-C alleles in Chinese population. Antigenicity scores of all predicted epitopes were analyzed using VaxiJen v2.0. The IEDB analysis revealed that 116 antigenic epitopes for HLA-A (21),-B (53), and-C (42) had high affinity for HLA molecules. Of them, 14 had 90.97-99.35% conversancy among the four serotypes. Moreover, five candidate epitopes, including 200NS5210 (94.84%, A*11:01), 515NS5525 (98.71%, A*24:02), 225NS5232 (99.35%, A*33:03), 516NS5523 (98.71%, A*33:03), and 284NS5291 (98.06%, A*33:03), were presented by HLA-A. Four candidate epitopes, including 234NS5241 (96.77%, B*13:01), 92NS599 (98.06%, B*15:01, B*15:02, and B*46:01), 262NS5269 (92.90%, B*38:02), and 538NS5547 (90.97%, B*51:01), were presented by HLA-B. Another 9 candidate epitopes, including 514NS5522 (98.71%, C*01:02), 514NS5524 (98.71%, C*01:02 and C*14:02), 92NS599 (98.06%, C*03:02 and C*15:02), 362NS5369 (44.84%, C*03:04 and C*08:01), 225NS5232 (99.35%, C*04:01), 234NS5241(96.77%, C*04:01), 361NS5369 (94.84%, C*04:01), 515NS5522 (98.71%, C*14:02), 515NS5524 (98.71%, C*14:02), were presented by HLA-C. Further data showed that the four-epitope combination of 92NS599 (B*15:01, B*15:02, B*46:01, C*03:02 and C*15:02), 200NS5210 (A*11:01), 362NS5369 (C*03:04, C*08:01), and 514NS5524 (C*01:02, C*14:02) could vaccinate >90% of individuals in China.

24647249,2014,Dengue virus neither directly mediates hyperpermeability nor enhances tumor necrosis factor-α-induced permeability in vitro.,"The mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction in dengue disease remain poorly understood. Endothelial cell (EC) death due to virus infection or in combination with an infection-induced cytokine storm is deemed as one of the major causes of plasma leakage. Using an in vitro model of human endothelia and several dengue virus (DENV) strains (including a clinical isolate), the direct consequence of infection on endothelial permeability was investigated throughout the course of the infection. All employed DENV-2 strains were able to infect and replicate in ECs. Rather than increase endothelial permeability, DENV infection alone enhanced cell barrier integrity up to 7 days postinfection. Improved cell barrier function was mediated by type I interferon activation at the early phase of infection and by the survival advantage of the infected cells at the late phase of infection. Consistent with this phenomenon, DENV infection did not augment tumor necrosis factor-α-induced permeability. Our results prove that DENV infection does not directly account for vascular permeability; DENV neither induces hyperpermeability nor exacerbates the permeabilizing effect of cytokines. The contributory role of other factors on plasma leakage during dengue disease warrants further investigation.

10559263,1999 Nov 19,A novel in vitro replication system for Dengue virus. Initiation of RNA synthesis at the 3'-end of exogenous viral RNA templates requires 5'- and 3'-terminal complementary sequence motifs of the viral RNA.,"Positive strand viral replicases are membrane-bound complexes of viral and host proteins. The mechanism of viral replication and the role of host proteins are not well understood. To understand this mechanism, a viral replicase assay that utilizes extracts from dengue virus-infected mosquito (C6/36) cells and exogenous viral RNA templates is reported in this study. The 5'- and 3'-terminal regions (TR) of the template RNAs contain the conserved elements including the complementary (cyclization) motifs and stem-loop structures. RNA synthesis in vitro requires both 5'- and 3'-TR present in the same template molecule or when the 5'-TR RNA was added in trans to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) RNA. However, the 3'-UTR RNA alone is not active. RNA synthesis occurs by elongation of the 3'-end of the template RNA to yield predominantly a double-stranded hairpin-like RNA product, twice the size of the template RNA. These results suggest that an interaction between 5'- and 3'-TR of the viral RNA that modulates the 3'-UTR RNA structure is required for RNA synthesis by the viral replicase. The complementary cyclization motifs of the viral genome also seem to play an important role in this interaction.

However, the characteristics of the 2023 circulating dengue virus (DENV) and the vector density remain poorly understood. Therefore, we performed DENV serotyping, clinical and laboratory assessment, and entomological analysis of the 2023 outbreak in central Nepal. A total of 396 fever cases in Dhading hospital suspected of being DENV positive were enrolled, and blood samples were collected and tested by different techniques including PCR. Of these, 278 (70.2%) had confirmed DENV infection. Multiple serotypes (DENV-1, -2, and -3) were detected. DENV-2 (97.5%) re-emerged after six years in Dhading while DENV-3 was identified for the first time. Dengue inpatients had significantly higher frequency of anorexia, myalgia, rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and thrombocytopenia (p < 0.05). In this area, Aedes mosquitoes largely predominated (90.7%) with the majority being A. aegypti (60.7%). We also found high levels of Aedes index (20.0%) and container index (16.7%).

32350095,2020 Apr 29,Under-the-Radar Dengue Virus Infections in Natural Populations of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes.,"The incidence of locally acquired dengue infections increased during the last decade in the United States, compelling a sustained research effort concerning the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, and its microbiome, which has been shown to influence virus transmission success. We examined the ""metavirome"" of four populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016 to 2017 in Manatee County, FL. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a 2-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, and explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of the DENV4 infections in A. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak.IMPORTANCE Since 1999, dengue outbreaks in the continental United States involving local transmission have occurred only episodically and only in Florida and Texas. In Florida, these episodes appear to be coincident with increased introductions of dengue virus into the region through human travel and migration from countries where the disease is endemic. To date, the U.S. public health response to dengue outbreaks has been largely reactive, and implementation of comprehensive arbovirus surveillance in advance of predictable transmission seasons, which would enable proactive preventative efforts, remains unsupported. The significance of our finding is that it is the first documented report of DENV4 transmission to and maintenance within a local mosquito vector population in the continental United States in the absence of a human case during two consecutive years. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of mosquito populations in high-risk, high-tourism areas of the United States may enable proactive, targeted vector control before potential arbovirus outbreaks.

33612798,2020 Jun 1,Viability of dengue virus in culture stocks is efficiently preserved by storage in diluted forms.,"Storage of dengue virus (DENV) culture stocks in -80°C is a common laboratory practice to maintain the viability of the virus for long-term usage. However, the efficiency of this method could still be hindered by multiple factors. In our laboratory, we observed a constant and substantial deterioration in the titer of DENV in Vero culture supernatant stored in -80°C. Such incident had badly hampered the laboratory work and prompted an investigation to determine the cause. DENV isolates representing all four serotypes were propagated and the culture supernatants were harvested and stored in aliquots of original stock and 10 fold dilutions (10(-1) -10(-4)). DENV titer in these stocks was determined prior to storage and reassessed on the third and sixth month of storage by focus forming unit assay (FFUA). The result demonstrated a constant preservation of titer ranging from 10(4) ffu/ml to 10(5) ffu/ml in the diluted DENV virus culture stocks of 10(-1), and 10(-2) of DENV1-4, a minor reduction of titer from 10(3) ffu/ml to 10(2) ffu/ml at dilution 10(-3) for DENV4 only and complete deterioration in undiluted culture stock and lower dilution (10(-4)) within 6 months of storage in -80°C for all serotypes. It is recommended that propagated DENV in Vero cells are stored in 10 fold dilutions as compared to the original form to preserve the titer for long-term usage.

31533688,2019 Sep 18,Anti-viral activity of culinary and medicinal mushroom extracts against dengue virus serotype 2: an in-vitro study.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has become a major public health concern worldwide. Presently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment available for dengue viral infection. METHODS: Lignosus rhinocerotis, Pleurotus giganteus, Hericium erinaceus, Schizophyllum commune and Ganoderma lucidium were selected for evaluation of their in-vitro anti-dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) activities. Hot aqueous extracts (HAEs), ethanol extracts (EEs), hexane soluble extracts (HSEs), ethyl acetate soluble extracts (ESEs) and aqueous soluble extracts (ASEs) were prepared from the selected mushrooms. The cytotoxic effects of the extracts were evaluated by the MTT assay. The anti-DENV-2 activities of the extracts were evaluated in three different assays: simultaneous, attachment and penetration assays were perfomed using plaque reduction assays and RT-qPCR assays. The effect of the addition time on viral replication was assessed by the time of addition assay, and a virucidal assay was carried out to evaluate the direct effect of each mushroom extract on DENV-2. The chemical composition of glucans, and the protein and phenolic acid contents in the extracts were estimated. RESULTS: We found that the HAEs and ASEs of L. rhinocerotis, P. giganteus, H. erinaceus and S. commune were the least toxic to Vero cells and showed very prominent anti-DENV2 activity. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of the ASEs ranged between 399.2-637.9 μg/ml, while for the HAEs the range was 312.9-680.6 μg/ml during simultaneous treatment. Significant anti-dengue activity was also detected in the penetration assay of ASEs (IC(50): 226.3-315.4 μg/ml) and HAEs (IC(50): 943.1-2080.2 μg/ml). Similarly, we observed a marked reduction in the expression levels of the ENV and NS5 genes in the simultaneous and penetration assays of the ASEs and HAEs. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the highest percent of anti-DENV2 activity was observed when the mushroom extracts were added immediately after virus adsorption. None of the extracts exhibited virucidal effect. Chemical composition analysis showed that the major components in the mushroom HAEs and ASEs were glucan (beta D-glucan) and proteins, however, there was no significant correlation between the anti-dengue activity and the concentration of glucans and proteins. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated the potential of mushroom extracts as anti-dengue therapeutic agents with less toxic effects.

38648407,2024 Jan 1,"Isolation and molecular detection of dengue and chikungunya virus from field-collected adult mosquitoes in Kelantan, Malaysia.","BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: Dengue and chikungunya infections are one of the major health problems that have plagued the human population globally. All dengue virus (DENV) serotypes circulate within Malaysia with particular serotypes dominating in different years/outbreaks. In the state of Kelantan, an increasing number of DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) new cases have been reported, including several deaths. This study aimed to isolate and detect these arboviruses from adult mosquitoes in Kelantan. METHODS: Adult mo squito samples were collected from January to August 2019 and were identified according to gender, species and locality. The isolation of the virus was done in C6/36 cells. Dengue NS1 antigen was carried out using direct mosquito lysate and mosquito culture supernatant. Detection and serotyping of the DENV was performed using multiplex RT-PCR and CHIKV detection using a one-step RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 91 mosquito pools, four were positive for NS1 antigen comprising two pools (2.2%) of male Ae. albopictus (Pulau Melaka and Kubang Siput) and two pools (2.2%) of Ae. aegypti (Kampung Demit Sungai). DENV 1 was detected in one pool (0.9%) of female Ae. albopictus among 114 tested Aedes pools. Two pools of 114 pools (1.7%) from both male Aedes species were positive with double serotypes, DENV 1 and DENV 2 (Pulau Melaka). However, no pool was positive for CHIKV. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSION: The presence of DENV and the main vectors of arboviruses in Kelantan are pertinent indicators of the need to improve vector controls to reduce arbovirus infections among people in the localities.

We examine fundamental mechanisms involved in the vesiculation processes induced by a cluster of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of the dengue virus (DENV) using molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model. We show that an arrangement of three E-M heterotetramers (EM(3)) works as a bending unit and an ordered cluster of five such units generates a closed vesicle, reminiscent of the virus budding process. In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane. The fine-tuning between the size of the EM(3) unit and its specific bending action suggests this protein unit is an important factor in determining the viral particle size.

27044528,2016 Apr 5,Presence of three dengue serotypes in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso): research and public health implications.,"BACKGROUND: The significant malaria burden in Africa has often eclipsed other febrile illnesses. Burkina Faso's first dengue epidemic occurred in 1925 and the most recent in 2013. Yet there is still very little known about dengue prevalence, its vector proliferation, and its poverty and equity impacts. METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional survey was performed from December 2013 to January 2014. Six primary healthcare centers in Ouagadougou were selected based on previously reported presence of Flavivirus. All patients consulting with fever or having had fever within the previous week and with a negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria were invited to participate. Sociodemographic data, healthcare use and expenses, mobility, health-related status, and vector control practices were captured using a questionnaire. Blood samples of every eligible subject were obtained through finger pricks during the survey for dengue RDT using SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo (NS1Ag and IgG/IgM)® and to obtain blood spots for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In a sample of randomly selected yards and those of patients, potential Aedes breeding sites were found and described. Larvae were collected and brought to the laboratory to monitor the emergence of adults and identify the species. RESULTS: Of the 379 subjects, 8.7 % (33/379) had positive RDTs for dengue. Following the 2009 WHO classification, 38.3 % (145/379) had presumptive, probable, or confirmed dengue, based on either clinical symptoms or laboratory testing. Of 60 samples tested by RT-PCR (33 from the positive tests and 27 from the subsample of negatives), 15 were positive. The serotypes observed were DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. Odds of dengue infection in 15-to-20-year-olds and persons over 50 years were 4.0 (CI 95 %: 1.0-15.6) and 7.7 (CI 95 %: 1.6-37.1) times higher, respectively, than in children under five. Average total spending for a dengue episode was 13 771 FCFA [1 300-67 300 FCFA] (1$US = 478 FCFA). On average, 2.6 breeding sites were found per yard. Potential Aedes breeding sites were found near 71.4 % (21/28) of patients, but no adult Aedes were found. The most frequently identified potential breeding sites were water storage containers (45.2 %). Most specimens collected in yards were Culex (97.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: The scientific community, public health authorities, and health workers should consider dengue as a possible cause of febrile illness in Burkina Faso.

25822571,2015 Jul,Comprehensive mapping infection-enhancing epitopes of dengue pr protein using polyclonal antibody against prM.,"Dengue vaccine development is considered a global public health priority, but the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) issues have critically restricted vaccine development. Recent findings have demonstrated that pre-membrane (prM) protein was involved in dengue virus (DENV) infection enhancement. Although the importance of prM antibodies have been well characterized, only a few epitopes in DENV prM protein have ever been identified. In this study, we screened five potential linear epitopes located at positions pr1 (1-16aa), pr3 (13-28aa), pr4 (19-34aa), pr9 (49-64aa), and pr10 (55-70aa) in pr protein using peptide scanning and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Then, we found that only pr4 (19-34aa) could elicit high-titer antibodies in Balb/c mice, and this epitope could react with sera from DENV2-infected patients, suggesting that specific antibodies against epitope peptide pr4 were elicited in both DENV-infected mice and human. In addition, our data demonstrated that anti-pr4 sera showed limited neutralizing activity but significant ADE activity toward standard DENV serotypes and imDENV.

36423184,2022 Nov 21,Immune-Mediated Pathogenesis in Dengue Virus Infection.,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the major public health concerns around the globe, especially in the tropical regions of the world that contribute to 75% percent of dengue cases. While the majority of DENV infections are mild or asymptomatic, approximately 5% of the cases develop a severe form of the disease that is mainly attributed to sequential infection with different DENV serotypes. The severity of dengue depends on many immunopathogenic mechanisms involving both viral and host factors. Emerging evidence implicates an impaired immune response as contributing to disease progression and severity by restricting viral clearance and inducing severe inflammation, subsequently leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Moreover, the ability of DENV to infect a wide variety of immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and T and B cells, further dysregulates the antiviral functions of these cells, resulting in viral dissemination. Although several risk factors associated with disease progression have been proposed, gaps persist in the understanding of the disease pathogenesis and further investigations are warranted.

30008269,2018 Jul 16,The Dengue virus in Nepal: gaps in diagnosis and surveillance.,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of the dengue virus (DENV) in Nepal is recent, first reports date back to 2004 from a Japanese traveller and limited information is available about DENV infection in the Nepali population. Within a decade after the first DENV detection, it is now endemic in multiple districts of Nepal with approximately 11.2 million people residing in the Terai belt being at risk of DENV infection. Sporadic cases of DENV infection have been reported every year for the past decade during the monsoon season, mainly in the Terai region. METHODS: Medline/Embase/Cochrane databases were reviewed for reports on the burden of dengue infection, diagnostic methods, and national surveillance. RESULTS: Four outbreaks were reported since 2004 including the diagnosis of all serotypes in 2006 and predominance of a single serotype in 2010 (DENV-1), 2013 (DENV-2), and 2016 (DENV-1). The clinical diagnoses showed a predominance of dengue fever while 4/917 (0.4%), 8/642 (1.2%) and 8/1615 (0.4%) dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome cases were identified during the outbreaks in 2010, 2013 and 2016, respectively. The number of cases reported in males was significantly higher (67.4%) than in females. Disease occurrence was primarily found in the Terai region until 2010 and was increasingly detected in the Hilly region in 2016. CONCLUSION: In Nepal currently weak diagnostic facilities, very limited research on mosquitoes vectors, and poor surveillance of dengue leading to inappropriate detection and control of DENV. We surmise that improved basic research and epidemiological training courses for local scientists and laboratory personal at national and international level will help better understand the evolution and distribution of DENV transmission and its eventual control. birendraphd@gmail.com.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nepal/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Serogroup', 'Young Adult']","['BACKGROUND: The introduction of the dengue virus (DENV) in Nepal is recent, first reports date back to 2004 from a Japanese traveller and limited information is available about DENV infection in the Nepali population.', 'Within a decade after the first DENV detection, it is now endemic in multiple districts of Nepal with approximately 11.2 million people residing in the Terai belt being at risk of DENV infection.', 'Sporadic cases of DENV infection have been reported every year for the past decade during the monsoon season, mainly in the Terai region.', 'METHODS: Medline/Embase/Cochrane databases were reviewed for reports on the burden of dengue infection, diagnostic methods, and national surveillance.', 'RESULTS: Four outbreaks were reported since 2004 including the diagnosis of all serotypes in 2006 and predominance of a single serotype in 2010 (DENV-1), 2013 (DENV-2), and 2016 (DENV-1).', 'The clinical diagnoses showed a predominance of dengue fever while 4/917 (0.4%), 8/642 (1.2%) and 8/1615 (0.4%) dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome cases were identified during the outbreaks in 2010, 2013 and 2016, respectively.', 'The number of cases reported in males was significantly higher (67.4%) than in females.', 'Disease occurrence was primarily found in the Terai region until 2010 and was increasingly detected in the Hilly region in 2016.', 'CONCLUSION: In Nepal currently\xa0weak diagnostic facilities, very\xa0limited research on mosquitoes\xa0vectors, and poor surveillance of dengue\xa0leading to inappropriate\xa0detection and\xa0control of DENV.

28441781,2017 Apr 24,Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 5.,"The World Health Organization estimates that the yearly number of dengue cases averages 390 million. This mosquito-borne virus disease is endemic in over 100 countries and will probably continue spreading, given the observed trend in global warming. So far, there is no antiviral drug available against dengue, but a vaccine has been recently marketed. Dengue virus also serves as a prototype for the study of other pathogenic flaviviruses that are emerging, like West Nile virus and Zika virus. Upon viral entry into the host cell and fusion of the viral lipid membrane with the endosomal membrane, the viral RNA is released and expressed as a polyprotein, that is then matured into three structural and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. The envelope, membrane and capsid proteins form the viral particle while NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B and NS5 assemble inside a cellular replication complex, which is embedded in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles. In addition to their roles in RNA replication within the infected cell, NS proteins help the virus escape the host innate immunity and reshape the host-cell inner structure. This review focuses on recent progress in characterizing the structure and functions of NS5, a protein responsible for the replication and capping of viral RNA that represents a promising drug target.

12482670,2002 Nov 10,Sequence diversity of the capsid gene and the nonstructural gene NS2B of dengue-3 virus in vivo.,"Previously, we studied the envelope (E) gene of dengue virus and reported that dengue-3 virus is present as a quasispecies. To investigate the extent of intrahost sequence variation of other dengue viral genes, we examined in this study the capsid (C) gene and the nonstructural gene, NS2B, derived directly from plasma dengue viruses from 18 confirmed dengue-3 patients. Using reverse transcription-PCR, multiple clones of a 360-nucleotide region covering the C gene and of a 404-nucleotide region covering the NS2B gene from each patient were completely sequenced and analyzed. Our findings of the intrahost sequence variation of the C and the NS2B genes (mean pairwise p-distance: 0.12 to 1.02%, and 0.16 to 1.20%, respectively) demonstrate the quasispecies structure of dengue virus in vivo. A linear relationship was found between the extent of sequence variation of the C and NS2B proteins, suggesting that intrahost sequence variation of dengue-3 virus is likely to reflect genetic drift. The extent of intrahost sequence variation observed is in the same range as that of acute human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus infection, indicating that the random mutation frequency of dengue virus is similar to that of other RNA viruses in vivo. Consistent with a previous report of the E gene, the observations of genome-defective clones in both the C and the NS2B genes (3.9 and 5.0% of the clones, respectively) suggest a higher frequency of defective viruses in vivo.

33046135,2020 Oct 12,Analysis of the virus propagation profile of 14 dengue virus isolates in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells.,"OBJECTIVE: The mosquito transmitted RNA virus dengue virus (DENV) shows significant variation as a consequence of the lack of proofreading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes new virus genomes. How this variation affects DENV replication, and how this in turn impacts drug development remains largely unknown. Given the technical limitations in working with large numbers of isolates few studies have sought to investigate this area. This study used a panel of 14 DENV isolates of different serotypes and origins to determine how much virus replication in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells was affected by DENV variability. RESULTS: The results showed that there was considerable variation, with peak titers ranging from 6Log10 to 8Log10, and maximum titer being reached from day 3 to day 9 post infection. While strains from DENV 1 and 4 serotypes showed considerable uniformity, DENV 2 and 3 strains showed much greater variation. Overall, these results show that serotype specific strain variation can have a significant impact on DENV replication, suggesting that studies either investigating DENV pathogenesis or developing drug therapeutics should consider the contribution of DENV variability.

We therefore undertook whole genome sequencing and evolutionary analysis of fourteen dengue virus (DENV)-2 strains sampled from Malindi sub-County Hospital during the 2017 DENV-2 outbreak in the Kenyan coast. We further performed an extended East African phylogenetic analysis, which leveraged 26 complete African env genes. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the 2017 outbreak was due to the Cosmopolitan genotype, indicating that this has been the only confirmed human DENV-2 genotype circulating in Africa to date. Phylogeographic analyses indicated transmission of DENV-2 viruses between East Africa and South/South-West Asia. Time-scaled genealogies show that DENV-2 viruses shows spatial structure at the country level in Kenya, with a time-to-most-common-recent ancestor analysis indicating that these DENV-2 strains were circulating for up to 5.38 years in Kenya before detection in the 2017 Malindi outbreak. Selection pressure analyses indicated sampled Kenyan DENV strains uniquely being under positive selection at 6 sites, predominantly across the non-structural genes, and epitope prediction analyses showed that one of these sites corresponds to a putative predicted MHC-I CD8+ DENV-2 Cosmopolitan virus epitope only evident in a sampled Kenyan virus. Taken together, our findings indicate that the 2017 Malindi DENV-2 outbreak arose from a strain which had circulated for several years in Kenya before recent detection, has experienced diversifying selection pressure, and may contain new putative immunogens relevant to vaccine design.

11483725,2001 Sep,Identification of a putative coreceptor on Vero cells that participates in dengue 4 virus infection.,"Dengue virus infects target cells by attaching to a cell surface receptor through the envelope (E) glycoprotein, located on the surface of the viral membrane. On Vero and BHK cells, heparan sulfate (HS) moieties of proteoglycans are the receptors for dengue virus; however, additional proteins have also been described as putative dengue virus receptors on C6/36, HL60, and BM cells. HS can also act as a receptor for other types of viruses or as an attachment molecule for viruses that require additional host cell molecules to allow viral penetration. In this study we searched for molecules other than HS that could participate in dengue virus infection of Vero cells. Labeled dengue 4 virus bound with high affinity to two molecules of 74 and 44 kDa. Binding of dengue virus to the 74-kDa molecule was susceptible to protease and sodium periodate treatment and resistant to heparinase treatments. Lectins such as concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin prevented dengue virus binding to both the 74- and the 44-kDa protein in overlay assays, while phytohemagglutinin P did not affect binding, suggesting that carbohydrate residues (alpha-mannose or N-acetylglucosamine) are important in virus binding to host cells. Protease susceptibility, biotin labeling, and immunofluorescence with a polyclonal antibody raised against the 74-kDa protein consistently identified the protein on the surfaces of Vero cells. Moreover, the antibody against the 74-kDa protein was able to inhibit dengue virus infection. These data suggest that HS might serve as a primary receptor, probably concentrating virus particles on the surfaces of Vero cells, and then other molecules, such as the 74-kDa protein, might participate as coreceptors in viral penetration. The 74-kDa protein possibly constitutes part of a putative receptor complex for dengue virus infection of Vero cells.

20980673,2010 Dec,A balance between circular and linear forms of the dengue virus genome is crucial for viral replication.,"The plasticity of viral plus strand RNA genomes is fundamental for the multiple functions of these molecules. Local and long-range RNA-RNA interactions provide the scaffold for interacting proteins of the translation, replication, and encapsidation machinery. Using dengue virus as a model, we investigated the relevance of the interplay between two alternative conformations of the viral genome during replication. Flaviviruses require long-range RNA-RNA interactions and genome cyclization for RNA synthesis. Here, we define a sequence present in the viral 3'UTR that overlaps two mutually exclusive structures. This sequence can form an extended duplex by long-range 5'-3' interactions in the circular conformation of the RNA or fold locally into a small hairpin (sHP) in the linear form of the genome. A mutational analysis of the sHP structure revealed an absolute requirement of this element for viral viability, suggesting the need of a linear conformation of the genome. Viral RNA replication showed high vulnerability to changes that alter the balance between circular and linear forms of the RNA. Mutations that shift the equilibrium toward the circular or the linear conformation of the genome spontaneously revert to sequences with different mutations that tend to restore the relative stability of the two competing structures. We propose a model in which the viral genome exists in at least two alternative conformations and the balance between these two states is critical for infectivity.","['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Circular/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/physiology', 'Dengue/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', '*Genome, Viral/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Phylogeny', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']","['The plasticity of viral plus strand RNA genomes is fundamental for the multiple functions of these molecules.', 'Local and long-range RNA-RNA interactions provide the scaffold for interacting proteins of the translation, replication, and encapsidation machinery.', 'Using dengue virus as a model, we investigated the relevance of the interplay between two alternative conformations of the viral genome during replication.', 'Flaviviruses require long-range RNA-RNA interactions and genome cyclization for RNA synthesis.', ""Here, we define a sequence present in the viral 3'UTR that overlaps two mutually exclusive structures."", ""This sequence can form an extended duplex by long-range 5'-3' interactions in the circular conformation of the RNA or fold locally into a small hairpin (sHP) in the linear form of the genome."", 'A mutational analysis of the sHP structure revealed an absolute requirement of this element for viral viability, suggesting the need of a linear conformation of the genome.', 'Viral RNA replication showed high vulnerability to changes that alter the balance between circular and linear forms of the RNA.', 'Mutations that shift the equilibrium toward the circular or the linear conformation of the genome spontaneously revert to sequences with different mutations that tend to restore the relative stability of the two competing structures.', 'We propose a model in which the viral genome exists in at least two alternative conformations and the balance between these two states is critical for infectivity.']"
30971466,2019 Jul,Development of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Rapid Detection of Dengue Virus (DENV) NS1 and Differentiation of DENV Serotypes during Early Infection.,"Dengue fever, caused by infections with the dengue virus (DENV), affects nearly 400 million people globally every year. Early diagnosis and management can reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of severe forms of dengue disease as well as decrease the risk of wider outbreaks. Although the early diagnosis of dengue can be achieved using a number of commercial NS1 detection kits, none of these can differentiate among the four dengue virus serotypes. In this study, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of dengue virus (DENV) NS1 by pairing a serotype-cross-reactive monoclonal antibody (MAb) with one of four serotype-specific MAbs in order to facilitate the rapid detection of NS1 antigens and the simultaneous differentiation of DENV serotypes. A total of 146 serum samples obtained from patients suspected to be in the acute phase of DENV infection were used to evaluate the clinical application of our novel test for the detection and serotyping of DENV. The overall sensitivity rate of our test was 84.85%, and the sensitivity rates for serotyping were as follows: 88.2% (15/17) for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1), 94.7% (18/19) for DENV2, 75% (12/16) for DENV3, and 66.6% (6/9) for DENV4. Moreover, there was no cross-reactivity among serotypes, and no cross-reactivity was observed in sera from nondengue patients. Thus, our test not only enables the rapid detection of the dengue virus but also can distinguish among the specific serotypes during the early stages of infection. These results indicate that our ELISA for DENV NS1 is a convenient tool that may help elucidate the epidemiology of DENV outbreaks and facilitate the clinical management of DENV infections. Taiwan.

25428248,2014 Nov 27,Death by dengue fever in a Brazilian child: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is an important worldwide public health problem, and continues to spread in Brazil. This article presents the first Brazilian case report of the death of an indigenous child by dengue fever. CASE PRESENTATION: In August 2013, a child aged 2 years and from the Tremembé ethnic group, who was previously healthy with no complaints, suddenly presented intense crying, precordial pain, and general malaise. A few minutes after these non-specific symptoms, the patient started tonic-clonic convulsions and had cyanosis, a substantial increase in body temperature to the touch, cold sudoresis, sphincter relaxation, and unconsciousness. This situation remained for 15 minutes, progressing to respiratory insufficiency, with consequent absence of peripheral pulses. Death was confirmed approximately 40 minutes after the first symptoms. An autopsy was performed using the usual techniques. Immunohistochemistry was positive for dengue, and microscopic examination indicated micro perivascular edema and cerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Considering that the death occurred during the major endemic seasonal period for dengue fever, primary clinical evidence suggestive of viral infection presenting with sudden and quick death, and positive immunohistochemistry results, the case was closed as severe dengue fever. Clinicians must consider dengue as a diagnostic hypothesis among the indigenous population in Brazil.

28771468,2017 Aug,Increasing airline travel may facilitate co-circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes in Asia.,"The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas with substantial transmission in 2014-2015. Yet the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes at large geographical scales remain elusive. Here we investigate the co-circulation in Asia of DENV serotypes 1-3 from 1956 to 2015, using a statistical framework that jointly estimates migration history and quantifies potential predictors of viral spatial diffusion, including socio-economic, air transportation and maritime mobility data. We find that the spread of DENV-1, -2 and -3 lineages in Asia is significantly associated with air traffic. Our analyses suggest the network centrality of air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India contribute to seeding dengue epidemics, whilst China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore may establish viral diffusion links with multiple countries in Asia. Phylogeographic reconstructions help to explain how growing air transportation networks could influence the dynamics of DENV circulation.

27058763,2016 Jun,Characterization of dengue virus 2 growth in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells.,"Megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) cells are potential in vivo targets of dengue virus (DENV); the virus has been found associated with megakaryocytes ex vivo and platelets during DENV-induced thrombocytopenia. We report here that DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) propagates well in human nondifferentiated MEP cell lines (Meg01 and K562). In comparison to virus propagated in Vero cells, viruses from MEP cell lines had similar structure and buoyant density. However, differences in MEP-DENV2 stability and composition were suggested by distinct protein patterns in western blot analysis. Also, antibody neutralization of envelope domain I/II on MEP-DENV2 was reduced relative to that on Vero-DENV2. Infectious DENV2 was produced at comparable kinetics and magnitude in MEP and Vero cells. However, fewer virion structures appeared in electron micrographs of MEP cells.

31767992,2020 Jan,Designer DNA architecture offers precise and multivalent spatial pattern-recognition for viral sensing and inhibition.,"DNA, when folded into nanostructures with a specific shape, is capable of spacing and arranging binding sites into a complex geometric pattern with nanometre precision. Here we demonstrate a designer DNA nanostructure that can act as a template to display multiple binding motifs with precise spatial pattern-recognition properties, and that this approach can confer exceptional sensing and potent viral inhibitory capabilities. A star-shaped DNA architecture, carrying five molecular beacon-like motifs, was constructed to display ten dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3)-targeting aptamers into a two-dimensional pattern precisely matching the spatial arrangement of ED3 clusters on the dengue (DENV) viral surface. The resulting multivalent interactions provide high DENV-binding avidity. We show that this structure is a potent viral inhibitor and that it can act as a sensor by including a fluorescent output to report binding. Our molecular-platform design strategy could be adapted to detect and combat other disease-causing pathogens by generating the requisite ligand patterns on customized DNA nanoarchitectures.

METHOD: We sequenced the complete envelope (E) gene of 33 dengue virus strains isolated from patients returning from Asia, Oceania, South Pacific islands, and South America to Japan where no domestic dengue virus infection occurs. We then performed phylogenetic analysis to define the geographic origin of isolated viruses. Moreover, we compared the genomes of isolated dengue viruses with those of the strains already deposited in the GenBank database. RESULT: The isolates are clustered into expected genotypes, confirming that the viruses originated from the visited countries. When patients visited more than one country during a single trip, the countries where the infection occurred were also determined for four of the six patients. There were three isolates, which were different genotypes from those previously isolated in visited countries. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that many dengue virus strains are introduced into Japan and that phylogenic analysis of isolated dengue viruses is a unique technique to determine the countries where infection occurred. Travelers carry viruses and provide important and unique information for clarifying dengue virus trait and its dissemination.","['Asia', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Dengue/classification/*genetics/*transmission', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*genetics', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/*classification', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'South America', '*Travel']","['BACKGROUND: Molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses in endemic countries have been reported, but few were reported on the imported dengue cases among travelers.', 'We analyzed dengue viruses isolated from imported dengue cases in Japan who were infected while traveling in endemic regions of the world.', 'METHOD: We sequenced the complete envelope (E) gene of 33 dengue virus strains isolated from patients returning from Asia, Oceania, South Pacific islands, and South America to Japan where no domestic dengue virus infection occurs.', 'We then performed phylogenetic analysis to define the geographic origin of isolated viruses.', 'Moreover, we compared the genomes of isolated dengue viruses with those of the strains already deposited in the GenBank database.', 'RESULT: The isolates are clustered into expected genotypes, confirming that the viruses originated from the visited countries.', 'When patients visited more than one country during a single trip, the countries where the infection occurred were also determined for four of the six patients.', 'There were three isolates, which were different genotypes from those previously isolated in visited countries.', 'CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that many dengue virus strains are introduced into Japan and that phylogenic analysis of isolated dengue viruses is a unique technique to determine the countries where infection occurred.', 'Travelers carry viruses and provide important and unique information for clarifying dengue virus trait and its dissemination.']"
30591706,2018 Dec 27,Selection and Characterization of Anti-Dengue NS1 Single Domain Antibodies.,"Reliable detection and diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) is important for both patient care and epidemiological control. Starting with a llama immunized with a mixture of recombinant nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen from the four DENV serotypes, a phage display immune library of single domain antibodies was constructed and binders selected which exhibited specificity and affinity for DENV NS1. Each of these single domain antibodies was evaluated for its binding affinity to NS1 from the four serotypes, and incorporated into a sandwich format for NS1 detection. An optimal pair was chosen that provided the best combination of sensitivity for all four DENV NS1 antigens spiked into 50% human serum while showing no cross reactivity to NS1 from Zika virus, yellow fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and minimal binding to NS1 from Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. These rugged and robust recombinant binding molecules offer attractive alternatives to conventional antibodies for implementation into immunoassays destined for resource limited locals. 4555 Overlook Ave SW, Washington, DC, 20375, USA. 4555 Overlook Ave SW, Washington, DC, 20375, USA. 4555 Overlook Ave SW, Washington, DC, 20375, USA.

23827321,2013 Nov,Mutant spectrum of dengue type 1 virus in the plasma of patients from the 2006 epidemic in South China.,"The aim of the present study was to explore the mutant spectrum of dengue type 1 virus (DENV-1) within individuals during the 2006 dengue epidemic in South China. A 513-bp fragment including most of domain III of the envelope (E) gene was amplified directly from clinical samples, then cloned and sequenced. A total of 89 clones from six patients (range 11-17 clones per patient) were sequenced. Genetic diversity was calculated using MEGA 4 package. The total number of nucleotide mutations was 113 (3.7%) within the sequenced 513-bp E gene, with a range of 15 (3%) to 24 (4.7%) within individual viral populations, harboring more non-synonymous than synonymous mutations. The extent of sequence diversity varied among patients, with the mean diversity ranging from 0.19% to 0.32%, and the mean pairwise p-distance ranging from 0.34% to 0.65%. No genome-defective virus was detected in any clone in this study. Purifying selection may be the main driving force for the intrahost evolution: the mean dN/dS ratio was 0.532.

The DENV 3' UTR has become a recent interest in research. The objective of the study was to examine the genetic variation in the domain II, 3' UTR region of human and mosquito-derived DENV. DENV-infected human sera were orally infected to laboratory reared Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The domain II, 3' UTR of each human- and mosquito-derived sample was amplified. The nucleotide sequence variation, phylogenetic and secondary structure analysis was carried out incorporating respective regions of so far recorded Sri Lankan and the reference genotype strains of the DENV3 and DENV1 serotypes. The human- and mosquito-derived domain II, 3' UTR were identical in nucleotide sequences within the serotypes isolated, indicating the conserved nature of the region during host switch. The sequence analysis revealed distinct variations in study isolates compared to so far recorded Sri Lankan isolates. However, despite single nucleotide variations, the maintenance of structural integrity was evident in related strains within the serotypes in the secondary structure analysis. The phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clade segregation of the study sequences from so far reported Sri Lankan isolates and illustrated the phylogenetic relations of the study sequences to the available global isolates of respective serotypes.

30228122,2018 Oct 2,Targeting intramolecular proteinase NS2B/3 cleavages for trans-dominant inhibition of dengue virus.,"Many positive-strand RNA viruses translate their genomes as single polyproteins that are processed by host and viral proteinases to generate all viral protein products. Among these is dengue virus, which encodes the serine proteinase NS2B/3 responsible for seven different cleavages in the polyprotein. NS2B/3 has been the subject of many directed screens to find chemical inhibitors, of which the compound ARDP0006 is among the most effective at inhibiting viral growth. We show that at least three cleavages in the dengue polyprotein are exclusively intramolecular. By definition, such a cis-acting defect cannot be rescued in trans This creates the possibility that a drug-susceptible or inhibited proteinase can be genetically dominant, inhibiting the outgrowth of drug-resistant virus via precursor accumulation. Indeed, an NS3-G459L variant that is incapable of cleavage at the internal NS3 junction dominantly inhibited negative-strand RNA synthesis of wild-type virus present in the same cell. This internal NS3 cleavage site is the junction most inhibited by ARDP0006, making it likely that the accumulation of toxic precursors, not inhibition of proteolytic activity per se, explains the antiviral efficacy of this compound in restraining viral growth. We argue that intramolecularly cleaving proteinases are promising drug targets for viruses that encode polyproteins. The most effective inhibitors will specifically target cleavage sites required for processing precursors that exert trans-dominant inhibition. 94305. 94305. Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.

29981375,2018 Sep,Posaconazole inhibits dengue virus replication by targeting oxysterol-binding protein.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is associated with an estimated 390 million infections per year, occurring across approximately 100 countries in tropical and sub-tropical regions. To date, there are no antiviral drugs or specific therapies to treat DENV infection. Posaconazole and itraconazole are potent antifungal drugs that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in fungal cells, but also target a number of human proteins. Here, we show that itraconazole and posaconazole have antiviral activity against DENV. Posaconazole inhibited replication of multiple serotypes of DENV and the related flavivirus Zika virus, and reduced viral RNA replication, but not translation of the viral genome. We used a combination of knockdown and drug sensitization assays to define the molecular target of posaconazole that mediates its antiviral activity. We found that knockdown of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) inhibited DENV replication. Moreover, knockdown of OSBP, but not other known targets of posaconazole, enhanced the inhibitory effect of posaconazole. Our findings imply OSBP as a potential target for the development of antiviral compounds against DENV. Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, P.O.

25122182,2014 Aug,MicroRNA-30e* suppresses dengue virus replication by promoting NF-κB-dependent IFN production.,"MicroRNAs have been shown to contribute to a repertoire of host-pathogen interactions during viral infection. Our previous study demonstrated that microRNA-30e* (miR-30e*) directly targeted the IκBα 3'-UTR and disrupted the NF-κB/IκBα negative feedback loop, leading to hyperactivation of NF-κB. This current study investigated the possible role of miR-30e* in the regulation of innate immunity associated with dengue virus (DENV) infection. We found that DENV infection could induce miR-30e* expression in DENV-permissive cells, and such an overexpression of miR-30e* upregulated IFN-β and the downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as OAS1, MxA and IFITM1, and suppressed DENV replication. Furthermore, suppression of IκBα mediates the enhancing effect of miR-30e* on IFN-β-induced antiviral response. Collectively, our findings suggest a modulatory role of miR-30e* in DENV induced IFN-β signaling via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether miR-30e* has an anti-DENV effect in vivo.

28336667,2017 Mar 24,Dengue diversity across spatial and temporal scales: Local structure and the effect of host population size.,"A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual transmission events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic transmission. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60% of dengue cases living <200 meters apart come from the same transmission chain, as opposed to 3% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances <200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the ""enclosed"" region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent transmission and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of transmission. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance. Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. henrik.salje@pasteur.fr justin@jhu.edu datc@ufl.edu. France.

24503088,2014 Feb,Generation and characterization of mouse monoclonal antibodies against NS4B protein of dengue virus.,"Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) has been demonstrated to be an attractive antiviral target. Due to its nature as an integral membrane protein, NS4B remains poorly characterized. In this study, we generated and characterized two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that selectively bind to DENV NS4B protein. One mAb, 10-3-7, is specific for DENV-2 NS4B, and its epitope was mapped to residues 5-15 of NS4B. The other mAb, 44-4-7, cross-reacts with all the four serotypes of DENV NS4B, and its epitope was mapped to residues 141-147 of NS4B. Using the mAbs, we probed the intracellular orientation of the epitopes of NS4B by an epitope accessibility assay. The results showed that the N-terminus of NS4B is located in the ER lumen, whereas amino acids 130-148 of NS4B are located in the cytosol. The study demonstrates that the two anti-NS4B mAbs will be useful for future structural and functional analyses of DENV NS4B. Singapore 138670, Singapore. Singapore 138670, Singapore.

31725752,2019,Molecular epidemiological characteristics of dengue virus carried by 34 patients in Guangzhou in 2018.,"Dengue fever is a major worldwide public health problem that, as estimated by the WHO, causes epidemics in over 100 countries, resulting in hundreds of millions of dengue virus (DENV) infections every year. In China, dengue fever mainly occurs in coastal areas. Recurring dengue outbreaks were reported by Guangdong Province almost every year since the first epidemic in 1978. DENV infections persisted in Guangzhou in consecutive years since 2000, with the dengue epidemic reaching a historical peak in 2014. Because Guangzhou is one of the largest cities for opening up in China, understanding the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever in the city can hopefully provide a significant basis for developing effective dengue prevention strategies. In this study, a total of 34 DENV strains, including 29 DENV-1 strains and 5 DENV-2 strains, were isolated from a blood samples drawn from patients who were diagnosed with dengue fever by hospitals in Guangzhou during 2018. To explore the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever, the envelope (E) gene obtained from the isolates was amplified for phylogenetic analysis. The results from the phylogenetic analysis showed that DENV in Guangzhou was mainly imported from Southeast Asian countries. Additionally, propagation paths based on phylogeographical analysis suggested potential local dengue transmission in Guangzhou. China. Guangzhou, China. Guangzhou, China.

25886260,2015 Feb 8,A small molecule inhibitor of dengue virus type 2 protease inhibits the replication of all four dengue virus serotypes in cell culture.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue has emerged as the most significant of arboviral diseases in the 21st century. It is endemic to >100 tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world placing an estimated 3.6 billion people at risk. It is caused by four genetically similar but antigenically distinct, serotypes of dengue viruses. There is neither a vaccine to prevent nor a drug to treat dengue infections, at the present time. The major objective of this work was to explore the possibility of identifying a small molecule inhibitor of the dengue virus protease and assessing its ability to suppress viral replication in cultured cells. METHODS: We cloned, expressed and purified recombinant dengue virus type 2 protease. Using an optimized and validated fluorogenic peptide substrate cleavage assay to monitor the activity of this cloned dengue protease we randomly screened ~1000 small molecules from an 'in-house' library to identify potential dengue protease inhibitors. RESULTS: A benzimidazole derivative, named MB21, was found to be the most potent in inhibiting the cloned protease (IC₅₀ = 5.95 μM). In silico docking analysis indicated that MB21 binds to the protease in the vicinity of the active site. Analysis of kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction suggested that MB21 presumably functions as a mixed type inhibitor. Significantly, this molecule identified as an inhibitor of dengue type 2 protease was also effective in inhibiting each one of the four serotypes of dengue viruses in infected cells in culture, based on analysis of viral antigen synthesis and infectious virus production. Interestingly, MB21 did not manifest any discernible cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This work strengthens the notion that a single drug molecule can be effective against all four dengue virus serotypes. The molecule MB21 could be a potential candidate for 'hit-to-lead' optimization, and may pave the way towards developing a pan-dengue virus antiviral drug.

25591713,2015 Jan 16,"Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of dengue type 1 virus isolated from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","BACKGROUND: Dengue viruses (DENVs) are mosquito-borne viruses which can cause disease ranging from mild fever to severe dengue infection. These viruses are endemic in several tropical and subtropical regions. Multiple outbreaks of DENV serotypes 1, 2 and 3 (DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3) have been reported from the western region in Saudi Arabia since 1994. Strains from at least two genotypes of DENV-1 (Asia and America/Africa genotypes) have been circulating in western Saudi Arabia until 2006. However, all previous studies reported from Saudi Arabia were based on partial sequencing data of the envelope (E) gene without any reports of full genome sequences for any DENV serotypes circulating in Saudi Arabia. FINDINGS: Here, we report the isolation and the first complete genome sequence of a DENV-1 strain (DENV-1-Jeddah-1-2011) isolated from a patient from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2011. Whole genome sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed high similarity between DENV-1-Jeddah-1-2011 strain and D1/H/IMTSSA/98/606 isolate (Asian genotype) reported from Djibouti in 1998. Further analysis of the full envelope gene revealed a close relationship between DENV-1-Jeddah-1-2011 strain and isolates reported between 2004-2006 from Jeddah as well as recent isolates from Somalia, suggesting the widespread of the Asian genotype in this region. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that strains belonging to the Asian genotype might have been introduced into Saudi Arabia long before 2004 most probably by African pilgrims and continued to circulate in western Saudi Arabia at least until 2011. Most importantly, these results indicate that pilgrims from dengue endemic regions can play an important role in the spread of new DENVs in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. Therefore, availability of complete genome sequences would serve as a reference for future epidemiological studies of DENV-1 viruses. University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. eazhar@kau.edu.sa.

34955490,2022 Mar 1,Synthesis and Anti-dengue Virus Activity of 5-Ethynylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICA) Nucleotide Prodrugs.,"We previously showed that 5-ethynyl-(1-β-D-ribofuranosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (1; EICAR) is a potent anti-dengue virus (DENV) compound but is cytotoxic to some cell lines, while its 4-thio derivative, 5-ethynyl-(4-thio-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (2; 4'-thioEICAR), has less cytotoxicity but also less anti-DENV activity. Based on the hypothesis that the lower anti-DENV activity of 2 is due to reduced susceptibility to phosphorylation by cellular kinase(s), we investigated whether a monophosphate prodrug of 2 can improve its activity. Here, we first prepared two types of prodrug of 1, which revealed that the S-acyl-2-thioethyl (SATE) prodrug had stronger anti-DENV activity than the aryloxyphosphoramidate (so-called ProTide) prodrug. Based on these findings, we next prepared the SATE prodrug of 4'-thioEICAR 18. As expected, the resulting 18 showed potent anti-DENV activity, which was comparable to that of 1; however, its cytotoxicity was also increased relative to 2. Our findings suggest that prodrugs of 4'-thioribonucleoside derivatives such as EICAR (1) represent an effective approach to developing potent biologically active compounds; however, the balance between antiviral activity and cytotoxicity remains to be addressed.

30689979,2019 Apr 1,Role of non-electrostatic forces in antimicrobial potency of a dengue-virus derived fusion peptide VG16KRKP: Mechanistic insight into the interfacial peptide-lipid interactions.,"Cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are emerging as effective alternatives to conventional therapeutics that are used against the ever-rising number of multidrug-resistant microbial strains. Most studies established the peptide's amphipathicity and electrostatic interaction with the membrane as the basis for their antimicrobial effect. However, the interplay between the stoichiometric ratio of lipids, local geometry, diverse physicochemical properties of the host membranes and antimicrobial peptide efficacy is still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of interaction of VG16KRKP (VARGWKRKCPLFGKGG), a novel AMP designed from the dengue-virus fusion peptide, with bacterial/fungal membrane mimics. Fluorescence based dye leakage assays show that membrane disruption is not solely induced by electrostatic interaction but also driven by stoichiometric ratio of the lipids that dictates the net surface charge, amount of lipid defects and local geometry of the membrane. Solid-state (14)N and (31)P NMR experiments show that peptide interaction results in lowering of lipid order around both the headgroups and acyl chains, suggesting deep peptide insertion. Further, an increase or decrease in membrane stability of the host membrane was observed in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms, dictated by the overall stoichiometric ratio of the lipids and the sterol present. In general, our results help understand the diverse fates of host membranes against an antimicrobial peptide. 700054, India.

32615988,2020 Jul 2,"Epidemiology and genetic diversity of circulating dengue viruses in Medellin, Colombia: a fever surveillance study.","BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Colombia. A fever surveillance study was conducted for evaluation of the clinical, epidemiological, and molecular patterns of dengue, prior to Chikungunya and Zika epidemics. METHODS: In November 2011-February 2014, a passive facility-based surveillance was implemented in Santa Cruz Hospital, Medellin, and enrolled eligible febrile patients between 1 and 65 years-of-age. Acute and convalescent blood samples were collected 10-21 days apart and tested for dengue using IgM/IgG ELISA. RNA was extracted for serotyping using RT-PCR on acute samples and genotyping was performed by sequencing. RESULTS: Among 537 febrile patients enrolled during the study period, 29% (n = 155) were identified to be dengue-positive. Only 7% of dengue cases were hospitalized, but dengue-positive patients were 2.6 times more likely to be hospitalized, compared to non-dengue cases, based on a logistic regression. From those tested with RT-PCR (n = 173), 17 were dengue-confirmed based on PCR and/or virus isolation showing mostly DENV-3 (n = 9) and DENV-4 (n = 7) with 1 DENV-1. Genotyping results showed that: DENV-1 isolate belongs to the genotype V or American/African genotype; DENV-3 isolates belong to genotype III; and DENV-4 isolates belong to the II genotype and specifically to the IIb sub-genotype or linage. CONCLUSIONS: Our surveillance documented considerable dengue burden in Santa Cruz comuna during non-epidemic years, and genetic diversity of circulating DENV isolates, captured prior to Chikungunya epidemic in 2014 and Zika epidemic in 2015. Our study findings underscore the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of dengue and other arboviruses and serve as epidemiological and molecular evidence base for future studies to assess changes in DENV transmission in Medellin, given emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases in the region.

21281507,2011 Jan 31,Dengue-2 structural proteins associate with human proteins to produce a coagulation and innate immune response biased interactome.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus infection is a public health threat to hundreds of millions of individuals in the tropical regions of the globe. Although Dengue infection usually manifests itself in its mildest, though often debilitating clinical form, dengue fever, life-threatening complications commonly arise in the form of hemorrhagic shock and encephalitis. The etiological basis for the virus-induced pathology in general, and the different clinical manifestations in particular, are not well understood. We reasoned that a detailed knowledge of the global biological processes affected by virus entry into a cell might help shed new light on this long-standing problem. METHODS: A bacterial two-hybrid screen using DENV2 structural proteins as bait was performed, and the results were used to feed a manually curated, global dengue-human protein interaction network. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment, along with network topology and microarray meta-analysis, were used to generate hypothesis regarding dengue disease biology. RESULTS: Combining bioinformatic tools with two-hybrid technology, we screened human cDNA libraries to catalogue proteins physically interacting with the DENV2 virus structural proteins, Env, cap and PrM. We identified 31 interacting human proteins representing distinct biological processes that are closely related to the major clinical diagnostic feature of dengue infection: haemostatic imbalance. In addition, we found dengue-binding human proteins involved with additional key aspects, previously described as fundamental for virus entry into cells and the innate immune response to infection. Construction of a DENV2-human global protein interaction network revealed interesting biological properties suggested by simple network topology analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental strategy revealed that dengue structural proteins interact with human protein targets involved in the maintenance of blood coagulation and innate anti-viral response processes, and predicts that the interaction of dengue proteins with a proposed human protein interaction network produces a modified biological outcome that may be behind the hallmark pathologies of dengue infection.

23742038,2013 Jun 7,Distinct regulation of dengue virus-induced inflammasome activation in human macrophage subsets.,"Macrophages (Mϕ) are the major source of inflammatory cytokines and are target cells for dengue virus (DV) replication. However, Mϕ are heterogeneous and their phenotypic and functional diversities are influenced by cytokines that regulate their differentiation, tissue distribution, and defense against invading pathogens. In vitro, human primary macrophages are derived from peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These are essential for developing tissue/resting macrophages (M-Mϕ) and inflammatory macrophages (GM-Mϕ), respectively. While IFN production is similar between M-Mϕ and GM-Mϕ, M-Mϕ cannot produce IL-1β after DV infection. In contrast, GM-Mϕ is more susceptible to DV infection and DV triggers CLEC5A in GM-Mϕ to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, which in turn release IL-18 and IL-1β that are critical for Th17 activation and contribute to disease severity. Thus, GM-Mϕ is more representative than M-Mϕ for investigating inflammasome activation in dengue infection, and is invaluable for revealing the molecular mechanism of pathogen-induced inflammatory reaction. Distinct phenotypes of macrophage subsets under the influence of M-CSF and GM-CSF raise the question of optimal conditions for culturing primary macrophages to study host-pathogen interaction.

As part of a wider programme (covering Latin America and South East Asia) to characterize the epidemiology of dengue in dengue endemic areas, we undertook a systematic literature review to assess epidemiological trends (incidence, timing and duration of outbreaks/epidemics, age and sex distribution, serotype distribution, seroprevalence and disease severity) for dengue across the French Territories of the Americas (FTA), in French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy between 2000 and 2012 (CRD42012002341: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42012002341). Of 413 relevant data sources identified, 45 were eligible for inclusion. A large proportion of the available data were from national surveillance reports, and 12 publications were from peer-reviewed journals. During the review period, 3-5 epidemics were identified in each of the island territories and French Guiana, and epidemics were often associated with a shift in the predominant circulating dengue virus serotype. Substantial gaps in epidemiological knowledge were identified. In particular, information regarding dengue virus genotype distribution, seroprevalence and age distribution of dengue were lacking. Additionally, much of the available data were from epidemic years; data from inter-epidemic periods were sparse. Nevertheless, the available epidemiological data showed that dengue is endemic across the FTA and suggest an evolution towards hyperendemicity, highlighting the need to continue the efforts with the existing surveillance programmes to assist in planning an effective vaccination programme once a dengue vaccine is deployed.

25107464,2014 Oct,"Severe dengue outbreak in Yunnan, China, 2013.","In recent decades, the impact of dengue has increased both geographically and in intensity, and this disease is now a threat to approximately half of the world's population. An unexpected large outbreak of dengue fever was reported in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, in 2013. This was the first autochthonous outbreak with a significant proportion of severe dengue cases in mainland China in a decade. According to the 2009 World Health Organization guidelines, half of the 136 laboratory confirmed cases during the epidemic were severe dengue. The clinical presentation included severe haemorrhage (such as massive vaginal and gastrointestinal bleeding), severe plasma leakage (such as pleural effusion, ascites, or hypoproteinaemia), and organ involvement (such as myocarditis and lung impairment); 21 cases eventually deteriorated to shock. During this outbreak, all severe cases occurred in adults, among whom about 43% had co-morbid conditions. Nucleic acid detection and virus isolation confirmed dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) to be the pathogenic agent of this outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of envelope gene sequences showed that these DENV-3 isolates belonged to genotype II. This finding is of great importance to understand the circulation of DENV and predict the risk of severe disease in mainland China. Here, we provide a brief report of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and aetiology of this dengue fever outbreak, and characterize DENV strains isolated from clinical specimens.

33014899,2020,Inflammasome Fuels Dengue Severity.,"Dengue is an acute febrile disease triggered by dengue virus. Dengue is the widespread and rapidly transmitted mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. Diverse symptoms and diseases due to Dengue virus (DENV) infection ranges from dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (life-threatening) and dengue shock syndrome characterized by shock, endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Several studies have linked the severity of dengue with the induction of inflammasome. DENV activates the NLRP3-specific inflammasome in DENV infected human patients, mice; specifically, mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), dendritic cells, endothelial cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), keratinocytes, monocyte-differentiated macrophages (THP-1), and platelets. Dengue virus mediated inflammasome initiates the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which are critical for dengue pathology and inflammatory response. Several studies have reported the molecular mechanism through which (host and viral factors) dengue induces inflammasome, unravels the possible mechanisms of DENV pathogenesis and sets up the stage for the advancement of DENV therapeutics. In this perspective article, we discuss the potential implications and our understanding of inflammasome mechanisms of dengue virus and highlight research areas that have potential to inhibit the pathogenesis of viral diseases, specifically for dengue. on behalf of the U.S. Government and, as regards Drs.

23587429,2014 Feb,"Molecular identification of the first local dengue fever outbreak in Shenzhen city, China: a potential imported vertical transmission from Southeast Asia?","A suspected dengue fever outbreak occurred in 2010 at a solitary construction site in Shenzhen city, China. To investigate this epidemic, we used serological, molecular biological, and bioinformatics techniques. Of nine serum samples from suspected patients, we detected seven positive for dengue virus (DENV) antibodies, eight for DENV-1 RNA, and three containing live viruses. The isolated virus, SZ1029 strain, was sequenced and confirmed as DENV-1, showing the highest E-gene homology to D1/Malaysia/36000/05 and SG(EHI)DED142808 strains recently reported in Southeast Asia. Further phylogenetic tree analysis confirmed their close relationship. At the epidemic site, we also detected 14 asymptomatic co-workers (out of 291) positive for DENV antibody, and DENV-1-positive mosquitoes. Thus, we concluded that DENV-1 caused the first local dengue fever outbreak in Shenzhen.

20582308,2010 Jun 22,Structural optimization and de novo design of dengue virus entry inhibitory peptides.,"Viral fusogenic envelope proteins are important targets for the development of inhibitors of viral entry. We report an approach for the computational design of peptide inhibitors of the dengue 2 virus (DENV-2) envelope (E) protein using high-resolution structural data from a pre-entry dimeric form of the protein. By using predictive strategies together with computational optimization of binding ""pseudoenergies"", we were able to design multiple peptide sequences that showed low micromolar viral entry inhibitory activity. The two most active peptides, DN57opt and 1OAN1, were designed to displace regions in the domain II hinge, and the first domain I/domain II beta sheet connection, respectively, and show fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of 8 and 7 microM respectively in a focus forming unit assay. The antiviral peptides were shown to interfere with virus:cell binding, interact directly with the E proteins and also cause changes to the viral surface using biolayer interferometry and cryo-electron microscopy, respectively. These peptides may be useful for characterization of intermediate states in the membrane fusion process, investigation of DENV receptor molecules, and as lead compounds for drug discovery.

Moreover, presence of four serotypes further complicates the prognosis. To investigate the predictors of disease severity and elucidate the prognostic markers among four dengue serotypes, this study was conducted on 320 inpatients having acute febrile illness clinically suspected as DI, over a period of five years. Dengue serotypes were confirmed by multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Eighty patients were positive for DI with presence of Den-1, Den-2, Den-3, and Den-4 in 8, 35, 27 and 10 patients, respectively. The severe clinical manifestations, abdominal pain and hepatomegaly, were comparatively higher in Den-2 patients. Liver aminotransferases levels were also higher in Den-2 patients (app. 5 fold).

29523827,2018 Mar 9,Hsp90 interacts with multiple dengue virus 2 proteins.,"Infections with the mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) remain a significant public health challenge. In the absence of a commercial therapeutic to treat DENV infection, a greater understanding of the processes of cellular replication is required. The abundant cellular chaperone protein heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been shown to play a proviral role in the replication cycle of several viruses, predominantly through the stabilization of specific viral proteins. To investigate any potential role of Hsp90 in DENV infection the interaction between Hsp90 and DENV proteins was determined through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Six DENV proteins namely envelope (E) and nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B and NS5 were shown to interact with Hsp90, and four of these proteins (E, NS1, NS3 and NS5) were shown to colocalize to a variable extent with Hsp90. Despite the extensive interactions between Hsp90 and DENV proteins, inhibition of the activity of Hsp90 had a relatively minor effect on DENV replication, with inhibition of Hsp90 resulting in a decrease of cellular E protein (but not nonstructural proteins) coupled with an increase of E protein in the medium and an increased virus titer.

36889142,2023 Apr,Analysing inhibition of dengue virus in Wolbachia-infected mosquito cells following the removal of Wolbachia.,"Wolbachia pipientis is known to block replication of positive sense RNA viruses. Previously, we created an Aedes aegypti Aag2 cell line (Aag2.wAlbB) transinfected with the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia and a matching tetracycline-cured Aag2.tet cell line. While dengue virus (DENV) was blocked in Aag2.wAlbB cells, we found significant inhibition of DENV in Aag2.tet cells. RNA-Seq analysis of the cells confirmed removal of Wolbachia and lack of expression of Wolbachia genes that could have been due to lateral gene transfer in Aag2.tet cells. However, we noticed a substantial increase in the abundance of phasi charoen-like virus (PCLV) in Aag2.tet cells. When RNAi was used to reduce the PCLV levels, DENV replication was significantly increased. Further, we found significant changes in the expression of antiviral and proviral genes in Aag2.tet cells. Overall, the results reveal an antagonistic interaction between DENV and PCLV and how PCLV-induced changes could contribute to DENV inhibition.

24664142,2014,Differential susceptibility of two field aedes aegypti populations to a low infectious dose of dengue virus.,"BACKGROUND: The infectious dose required to infect mosquito vectors when they take a blood meal from a viremic person is a critical parameter underlying the probability of dengue virus (DENV) transmission. Because experimental vector competence studies typically examine the proportion of mosquitoes that become infected at intermediate or high DENV infectious doses in the blood meal, the minimum blood meal titer required to infect mosquitoes is poorly documented. Understanding the factors influencing the lower infectiousness threshold is epidemiologically significant because it determines the transmission potential of humans with a low DENV viremia, possibly including inapparent infections, and during the onset and resolution of the viremic period of acutely infected individuals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the susceptibility of two field-derived Aedes aegypti populations from Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand when they were orally exposed to low titers of six DENV-2 isolates derived from the serum of naturally infected humans living in the same region. The infectious dose, time-point post-blood feeding, viral isolate and mosquito population, were significant predictors of the proportion of mosquitoes that became infected. Importantly, the dose-response profile differed significantly between the two Ae. aegypti populations. Although both mosquito populations had a similar 50% oral infectious dose (OID50), the slope of the dose-response was shallower in one population, resulting in a markedly higher susceptibility at low blood meal titers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that mosquitoes in nature vary in their infectious dose-response to DENV. Thus, different mosquito populations have a differential ability to acquire DENV infection at low viremia levels. Future studies on human-to-mosquito DENV transmission should not be limited to OID50 values, but rather they should be expanded to account for the shape of the dose-response profile across a range of virus titers.

11473994,2001 Aug,Detection of dengue viral RNA using a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay.,"Faster techniques are needed for the early diagnosis of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever during the acute viremic phase of infection. An isothermal nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay was optimized to amplify viral RNA of all four dengue virus serotypes by a set of universal primers and to type the amplified products by serotype-specific capture probes. The NASBA assay involved the use of silica to extract viral nucleic acid, which was amplified without thermocycling. The amplified product was detected by a probe-hybridization method that utilized electrochemiluminescence. Using normal human plasma spiked with dengue viruses, the NASBA assay had a detection threshold of 1 to 10 PFU/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined by testing 67 dengue virus-positive and 21 dengue virus-negative human serum or plasma samples. The ""gold standard"" used for comparison and evaluation was the mosquito C6/36 cell culture assay followed by an immunofluorescent assay. Viral infectivity titers in test samples were also determined by a direct plaque assay in Vero cells. The NASBA assay was able to detect dengue viral RNA in the clinical samples at plaque titers below 25 PFU/ml (the detection limit of the plaque assay). Of the 67 samples found positive by the C6/36 assay, 66 were found positive by the NASBA assay, for a sensitivity of 98.5%.

38018543,2023,Pathway analysis of host responses to dengue virus serotype 2 infection and inhibition of viral envelope protein by naringenin from Ganoderma lucidum.,"Dengue fever cases are spiking over the last two decades. Incessant efforts are still being made to gain deeper insights on this arboviral disease and to identify bioactive antivirals. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the expression profiling datasets of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) patients. We found overexpressed genes in dengue patients that can interrupt cell cycle progression and phase transitions of mitosis inside the host to favour the viral replication process. These DEGs were associated with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways such as cell cycle and DNA replication. A protein interaction network consisting of these significant pathways was also constructed using STRING. Futher, the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds from Ganoderma lucidum were screened to target DENV2 envelope protein, which was crucial for viral fusion activity. Docking, orbital energy, and toxicity prediction analysis revealed that naringenin was the best antiviral candidate. Following molecular dynamics simulations, the predicted binding energy of the protein-naringenin system using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) approach was slightly greater than the control system.

We found that E protein is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where assembly of RSPs could be observed. Biochemical characterization of DV1 RSPs secretion revealed both prM protein cleavage and homodimerization of E proteins before their release into the supernatant, indicating that RSPs undergo a similar maturation process as dengue virus. Pulse chase experiment showed that 8 hours are required for the secretion of DV1 RSPs. We have used HeLa-prME to develop a semi-quantitative assay and screened a human siRNA library targeting genes involved in membrane trafficking. Knockdown of 23 genes resulted in a significant reduction in DV RSP secretion, whereas for 22 others we observed an increase of RSP levels in cell supernatant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data describe the efficient production of RSPs containing native prM and E envelope proteins for all dengue serotypes. Dengue RSPs and corresponding producing cell lines are safe and novel tools that can be used in the study of viral egress as well as in the development of vaccine and drugs against dengue virus.

BALB/c mice were intraperitoneal infected with DENV-2 obtained from a human patient. Histopathological analysis of infected animals revealed liver injury with viral antigens detection. In initial stages, the most prominent lesions were vacuolization and diffuse steatosis in hepatocytes. Serum levels of ALT and AST increased progressively, reaching the highest values 7 days p.i. and decreasing at the 14th day. Since levels of circulating virus were very low, viremia was analyzed in C6/36 cells. Virus presence was detected by ultrastructural analysis, confirmed by RT-PCR assays. Period of viremia was analyzed by flow cytometry with cells incubated with mouse-infected sera collected in different days, revealing peak virus levels at the 7th day p.i.

1531368,1992 Mar,"Cleavage of the dengue virus polyprotein at the NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 junctions is mediated by viral protease NS2B-NS3, whereas NS4A/NS4B may be processed by a cellular protease.","The cleavage mechanism utilized for processing of the NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 domain of the dengue virus polyprotein was studied by using the vaccinia virus expression system. Recombinant vaccinia viruses vNS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5, vNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5, vNS4A-NS4B-NS5, and vNS4B-NS5 were constructed. These recombinants were used to infect cells, and the labeled lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Recombinant vNS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 expressed the authentic NS3 and NS5 proteins, but the other recombinants produced uncleaved polyproteins. These findings indicate that NS2B is required for processing of the downstream nonstructural proteins, including the NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 junctions, both of which contain a dibasic amino acid sequence preceding the cleavage site. The flavivirus NS4A/NS4B cleavage site follows a long hydrophobic sequence. The polyprotein NS4A-NS4B-NS5 was cleaved at the NS4A/NS4B junction in the absence of other dengue virus functions. One interpretation for this finding is that NS4A/NS4B cleavage is mediated by a host protease, presumably a signal peptidase. Although vNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 expressed only the polyprotein, earlier results demonstrated that cleavage at the NS4A/NS4B junction occurred when an analogous recombinant, vNS3-NS4A-84%NS4B, was expressed. Thus, it appears that uncleaved NS3 plus NS5 inhibit NS4A/NS4B cleavage presumably because the putative signal sequence is not accessible for recognition by the responsible protease. Finally, recombinants that expressed an uncleaved NS4B-NS5 polyprotein, such as vNS4A-NS4B-NS5 or vNS4B-NS5, produced NS5 when complemented with vNS2B-30%NS3 or with vNS2B plus v30%NS3.

23281804,2012,Feasibility of using 454 pyrosequencing for studying quasispecies of the whole dengue viral genome.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is the world's most common mosquito-borne viral disease. Poor proofreading by RNA polymerase during its replication results in the accumulation of mutations in its genome. This leads to a diversity of genotypes in the viral population termed quasispecies. Quasispecies play an important role in disease severity. The study of quasispecies in dengue has been hindered because of the requirement for large amounts of cloning and sequencing, which could be overcome by 454 pyrosequencing. In this study, we attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of using 454 pyrosequencing to study genome diversity of dengue virus quasispecies by sequencing a pool of known dengue viral strains. RESULTS: Two sets of dengue DNA templates were sequenced by 454/Roche GS FLX. The total number of reads for data 1 and data 2 were 54,440 and 134,441, with average lengths of 221 and 232 bp, respectively. Reads containing ambiguous base Ns were excluded (6.00% in data 1, 7.05% in data 2). More than 99% of reads could be aligned back to the correct serotypes by BLAST. The reads covered the whole genome without any gaps, and the minimum coverage depth was 50×. Frequencies of known strains detected from each data set were highly correlated with the input ratios. We also explored criteria for filtering error reads and artifacts from true variations. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 454 pyrosequencing, coupled with our analysis procedure, could sequence the whole genome of dengue virus with good coverage. The ratio of detected variants in the sequencing data reflected the starting ratio, proving that the proposed technique could be used to study the frequencies of variants in quasispecies.

We used this methodology in order to detect and quantify dengue antigens in highly susceptible cells such as clone C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and Vero cells (green monkey kidney). Additionally, we analyzed the infection in vitro of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML). FACS analysis turned out to be a reliable technique to quantify virus growth in traditional cell cultures of C6/36 as well as Vero cells. High rates of infection were achieved with a good statistical correlation between the virus amount used in infection and the percentage of dengue antigen containing cells detected in infected cultures. We also showed that human monocytes (CD14+) are preferred target cells for in vitro dengue infection among PBML. Monocytes were much less susceptible to virus infection than cell lines but they displayed dengue antigens detected by FACS five days after infection. In contrast, lymphocytes showed no differences in their profile for dengue specific immunofluorescence. Without an animal model to reproduce dengue disease, alternative assays have been sought to correlate viral virulence with clinical manifestations and disease severity.

We show that DENV2 NS5 arginine 888, located within the carboxy-terminal 18 residues, is completely conserved in all flaviviruses and interacts specifically with the top-loop of 3'SL in the 3'UTR which contains the pentanucleotide 5'-CACAG-3' previously shown to be critical for flavivirus RNA replication. We present virological and biochemical data showing the importance of this Arg 888 in virus viability and de novo initiation of RNA polymerase activity in vitro.

28346446,2017 Mar 27,Dengue virus NS2B protein targets cGAS for degradation and prevents mitochondrial DNA sensing during infection.,"During the last few decades, the global incidence of dengue virus (DENV) has increased dramatically, and it is now endemic in more than 100 countries. To establish a productive infection in humans, DENV uses different strategies to inhibit or avoid the host innate immune system. Several DENV proteins have been shown to strategically target crucial components of the type I interferon system. Here, we report that the DENV NS2B protease cofactor targets the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) for lysosomal degradation to avoid the detection of mitochondrial DNA during infection. Such degradation subsequently results in the inhibition of type I interferon production in the infected cell.

19264337,2009 Apr 25,Antiviral activity of carbohydrate-binding agents and the role of DC-SIGN in dengue virus infection.,"Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important binding receptor for dengue virus (DENV) that recognizes N-glycosylation sites on the viral E-glycoprotein. DENV cannot bind nor infect the human B-cell line Raji/0. However, DENV productively infects Raji/DC-SIGN(+) cells that constitutively express DC-SIGN on their surface. IL-4-treated monocytes, expressing high levels of DC-SIGN, are also susceptible for DENV infection. Several carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs), such as the plant lectins HHA, GNA (mannose-specific) and UDA (N-acetylglucosamine-specific), inhibited dose-dependently the binding of DENV and subsequently viral replication in Raji/DC-SIGN(+) cells (EC(50): 0.1-2.2 microM).

26789921,2016 Jan 19,"Targeting Viral Proteostasis Limits Influenza Virus, HIV, and Dengue Virus Infection.","Viruses are obligate parasites and thus require the machinery of the host cell to replicate. Inhibition of host factors co-opted during active infection is a strategy hosts use to suppress viral replication and a potential pan-antiviral therapy. To define the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus during infection is thus crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally induced disease. In this report, we generated fully infectious tagged influenza viruses and used infection-based proteomics to identify pivotal arms of cellular signaling required for influenza virus growth and infectivity. Using mathematical modeling and genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we revealed that modulation of Sec61-mediated cotranslational translocation selectively impaired glycoprotein proteostasis of influenza as well as HIV and dengue viruses and led to inhibition of viral growth and infectivity. Thus, by studying virus-human protein-protein interactions in the context of active replication, we have identified targetable host factors for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. 10029-6574, USA. 10029-6574, USA; Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA.

23374123,2013 Feb,Factors shaping the adaptive landscape for arboviruses: implications for the emergence of disease.,"Many examples of the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases involve the adaptation of zoonotic viruses to new amplification hosts or to humans themselves. These include several instances of simple mutational adaptations, often to hosts closely related to the natural reservoirs. However, based on theoretical grounds, arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, may face several challenges for adaptation to new hosts.

29813061,2018 May,Viral immunogenicity determines epidemiological fitness in a cohort of DENV-1 infection in Brazil.,"The dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) circulation depends on serotype, genotype and lineage replacement and turnover. In São José do Rio Preto, Brazil, we observed that the L6 lineage of DENV-1 (genotype V) remained the dominant circulating lineage even after the introduction of the L1 lineage. We investigated viral fitness and immunogenicity of the L1 and L6 lineages and which factors interfered with the dynamics of DENV epidemics. The results showed a more efficient replicative fitness of L1 over L6 in mosquitoes and in human and non-human primate cell lines. Infections by the L6 lineage were associated with reduced antigenicity, weak B and T cell stimulation and weak host immune system interactions, which were associated with higher viremia. Our data, therefore, demonstrate that reduced viral immunogenicity and consequent greater viremia determined the increased epidemiological fitness of DENV-1 L6 lineage in São José do Rio Preto.

37932414,2023 Nov 6,"Nutritional stress compromises mosquito fitness and antiviral immunity, while enhancing dengue virus infection susceptibility.","Diet-induced nutritional stress can influence pathogen transmission potential in mosquitoes by impacting life history traits, infection susceptibility, and immunity. To investigate these effects, we manipulate mosquito diets at larval and adult stages, creating two nutritional levels (low and normal), and expose adults to dengue virus (DENV). We observe that egg number is reduced by nutritional stress at both stages and viral exposure separately and jointly, while the likelihood of laying eggs is exclusively influenced by adult nutritional stress. Adult nutritional stress alone shortens survival, while any pairwise combination between both-stage stress and viral exposure have a synergistic effect. Additionally, adult nutritional stress increases susceptibility to DENV infection, while larval nutritional stress likely has a similar effect operating via smaller body size. Furthermore, adult nutritional stress negatively impacts viral titers in infected mosquitoes; however, some survive and show increased titers over time. The immune response to DENV infection is overall suppressed by larval and adult nutritional stress, with specific genes related to Toll, JAK-STAT, and Imd immune signaling pathways, and antimicrobial peptides being downregulated. Our findings underscore the importance of nutritional stress in shaping mosquito traits, infection outcomes, and immune responses, all of which impact the vectorial capacity for DENV transmission.

10405398,1999 Aug,Detection of dengue virus RNA in patients after primary or secondary dengue infection by using the TaqMan automated amplification system.,"In consecutive serum samples from 25 tourists with acute dengue fever, virus-specific RNA was detected by using fully automated TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR. For this amplification technique new primers and special fluorochrome-labeled probes had to be synthesized. During amplification the increasing amount of viral DNA could simultaneously be measured in the tightly sealed tubes. Dengue virus RNA was found in almost all patients (17 of 18), if the samples had been taken soon after the onset of symptoms and before anti-dengue virus antibody had been produced. RNA was detectable in only one of five persons who had anti-dengue virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies but not yet IgG antibodies. In 30 late samples with both IgG and IgM antibodies viral RNA was no longer demonstrable. In two early samples from two frequent travelers obtained 1 and 2 days after the onset of symptoms significant IgG antibody titers were present but there were no anti-dengue virus IgM antibodies. In these samples a viral load of >5 x 10(6) dengue virus RNA copies (dengue types 1 and 2) was detectable. These findings of a high viral load in the presence of anti-dengue virus IgG antibody are suggestive of a secondary dengue virus infection. In the 20 tourists (17 plus 1 plus 2) in whom viral RNA was found, the dengue virus serotype could be related to the area where the infection had taken place. Most of our patients came from southeast Asia and most frequently had dengue virus type 1 infections (8 of 20).

34048474,2021,Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of dengue virus serotypes circulating at the Colombian-Venezuelan border during 2015-2016 and 2018-2019.,"Dengue is an endemic disease in Colombia. Norte de Santander is a region on the border of Colombia and Venezuela and has reported the co-circulation and simultaneous co-infection of different serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV). This study aimed to conduct a phylogenetic analysis on the origin and genetic diversity of DENV strains circulating in this bordering region. Serum samples were collected from patients who were clinically diagnosed with febrile syndrome associated with dengue during two periods. These samples were tested for DENV and serotyping was performed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, positive samples were amplified and the envelope protein gene of DENV was sequenced. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed using the sequences obtained. Basic local alignment search tool analysis confirmed that six and eight sequences belonged to DENV-1 and DENV-2, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 showed that the sequences belonged to genotype V and clade I; they formed two groups: in the first group, two sequences showed a close phylogenetic relationship with strains from Ecuador and Panama, whereas the other four sequences were grouped with strains from Venezuela and Colombia. In the case of DENV-2, the analysis revealed that the sequences belonged to the Asian-American genotype and clade III. Furthermore, they formed two groups; in the first group, three sequences were grouped with strains from Colombia and Venezuela, whereas the other five were grouped with strains from Venezuela, Colombia and Honduras. This phylogenetic analysis suggests that the geographical proximity between Colombia and Venezuela is favourable for the export and import of different strains among serotypes or clades of the same DENV serotype, which could favour the spread of new outbreaks caused by new strains or genetic variants of this arbovirus. Therefore, this information highlights the importance of monitoring the transmission of DENV at border regions. Colombia, Bucaramanga, Colombia. Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.

9696848,1998 Sep,Identification of specific nucleotide sequences within the conserved 3'-SL in the dengue type 2 virus genome required for replication.,"The flavivirus genome is a positive-stranded approximately 11-kb RNA including 5' and 3' noncoding regions (NCR) of approximately 100 and 400 to 600 nucleotides (nt), respectively. The 3' NCR contains adjacent, thermodynamically stable, conserved short and long stem-and-loop structures (the 3'-SL), formed by the 3'-terminal approximately 100 nt. The nucleotide sequences within the 3'-SL are not well conserved among species. We examined the requirement for the 3'-SL in the context of dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) replication by mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA copy of a DEN2 genome. Genomic full-length RNA was transcribed in vitro and used to transfect monkey kidney cells. A substitution mutation, in which the 3'-terminal 93 nt constituting the wild-type (wt) DEN2 3'-SL sequence were replaced by the 96-nt sequence of the West Nile virus (WN) 3'-SL, was sublethal for virus replication. An analysis of the growth phenotypes of additional mutant viruses derived from RNAs containing DEN2-WN chimeric 3'-SL structures suggested that the wt DEN2 nucleotide sequence forming the bottom half of the long stem and loop in the 3'-SL was required for viability. One 7-bp substitution mutation in this domain resulted in a mutant virus that grew well in monkey kidney cells but was severely restricted in cultured mosquito cells. In contrast, transpositions of and/or substitutions in the wt DEN2 nucleotide sequence in the top half of the long stem and in the short stem and loop were relatively well tolerated, provided the stem-loop secondary structure was conserved.

30970587,2019 Apr 9,Annexin II as a Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Interacting Protein Mediating Virus Interaction on Vero Cells.,"Recent evidence has demonstrated that dengue virus requires active filopodia formation for a successful infection. However, the cellular factor involved in the interaction has not been fully elucidated. We used a combination of virus overlay protein binding assay and LC-MS/MS, and identified annexin II as a dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) interacting protein on Vero cells, upon filopodia induction. Flow cytometry analysis showed annexin II on the Vero cells surface increased when DENV2 was added. The amount of annexin II in the plasma membrane fraction was reduced as the infection progressed. Antibody-mediated inhibition of infection and siRNA-mediated knockdown of annexin II expression significantly reduced DENV2 infection and production levels. Collectively, we demonstrated that annexin II is one of the host factor involved in DENV2 binding on Vero cells.

29412340,2018 Feb 5,First detection of dengue virus in the saliva of immunocompetent murine model.,"The lack of an experimental animal model for the study of dengue pathogenesis is a limiting factor for the development of vaccines and drugs. In previous studies, our group demonstrated the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection by dengue virus (DENV) 1 and 2, and the virus was successfully isolated in several organs. In this study, BALB/c mice were experimentally infected intravenously with DENV-4, and samples of their saliva were collected. Viral RNA extracted from the saliva samples was subjected to qRT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.002 PFU/mL. The presence of DENV-4 viral RNA was detected in the saliva of two mice, presenting viral titers of 109 RNA/mL. The detection of DENV RNA via saliva sampling is not a common practice in dengue diagnosis, due to the lower detection rates in human patients. However, the results observed in this study seem to indicate that, as in humans, detection rates of DENV RNA in mouse saliva are also low, correlating the infection in both cases.

Flavivirus infections also produce combined 'mosaic' particles. Here, using cryo-electron tomography, we report that mosaic particles of dengue virus type 2 had glycoproteins organized into two regions of mature and immature structure. Furthermore, particles of a maturation-deficient mutant had their glycoproteins organized into two regions of immature structure with mismatching icosahedral symmetries. It is therefore apparent that the maturation-related reorganization of the flavivirus glycoproteins is not synchronized across the whole virion, but is initiated from one or more nucleation centres. Similar deviation from icosahedral symmetry might be relevant to the asymmetrical mode of genome packaging and cell entry of other viruses.

23760248,2013 Sep,How positive-strand RNA viruses benefit from autophagosome maturation.,"The autophagic degradation pathway is a powerful tool in the host cell arsenal against cytosolic pathogens. Contents trapped inside cytosolic vesicles, termed autophagosomes, are delivered to the lysosome for degradation. In spite of the degradative nature of the pathway, some pathogens are able to subvert autophagy for their benefit. In many cases, these pathogens have developed strategies to induce the autophagic signaling pathway while inhibiting the associated degradation activity. One surprising finding from recent literature is that some viruses do not impede degradation but instead promote the generation of degradative autolysosomes, which are the endpoint compartments of autophagy. Dengue virus, poliovirus, and hepatitis C virus, all positive-strand RNA viruses, utilize the maturation of autophagosomes into acidic and ultimately degradative compartments to promote their replication. While the benefits that each virus reaps from autophagosome maturation are unique, the parallels between the viruses indicate a complex relationship between cytosolic viruses and host cell degradation vesicles.

To date, there is no clinically approved dengue vaccine or antiviral for human beings, even though there have been great efforts to accomplish these goals. Several approaches have been used in the search for dengue antivirals such as screening of compounds against dengue virus enzymes and structure-based computational discovery. During the last decades, researchers have turned their attention to nature, trying to identify compounds that can be used as dengue antivirals. Nature represents a vast reservoir of substances that can be explored with the aim of discovering new leads that can be either used directly as pharmaceuticals or can serve as lead structures that can be optimized towards the development of new antiviral agents against dengue. In this review we describe an assortment of natural products that have been reported as possessing dengue antiviral activity. The natural products are organized into classes of substances.

32357182,2020 May,A conformation-based intra-molecular initiation factor identified in the flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.,"The flaviviruses pose serious threats to human health. Being a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), NS5 is the most conserved flavivirus protein and an important antiviral target. Previously reported NS5 structures represented by those from the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) exhibit two apparently different global conformations, defining two sets of intra-molecular MTase-RdRP interactions. However, whether these NS5 conformations are conserved in flaviviruses and their specific functions remain elusive. Here we report two forms of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5 crystal structures representing two conformational states with defined analogies to the JEV-mode and DENV3-mode conformations, respectively, demonstrating the conservation of both conformation modes and providing clues for how different conformational states may be interconnected. Data from in vitro polymerase assays further demonstrate that perturbing the JEV-mode but not the DENV3-mode intra-molecular interactions inhibits catalysis only at initiation, while the cell-based virological analysis suggests that both modes of interactions are important for virus proliferation. Our work highlights the role of MTase as a unique intra-molecular initiation factor specifically only through the JEV-mode conformation, providing an example of conformation-based crosstalk between naturally fused protein functional modules.

36279305,2022 Oct,Chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids in Aedes aegypti cells dysregulates lipid metabolism and inhibits innate immunity without altering dengue infectivity.,"Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue virus (DENV) and other arboviruses. Previous literature suggests that vertebrate and invertebrate lipids and the nutritional status of mosquitoes modify virus infection. Here, we developed a vertebrate lipid-depleted Ae. aegypti cell line to investigate if chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids normally present in a blood meal and insect cell culture medium would impact cell growth and virus infection. Chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids reduced cell size and proliferation, although cells retained equivalent total intracellular lipids per cell by reducing lipolysis and modifying gene expression related to sugar and lipid metabolism. Downregulation of innate immunity genes was also observed. We hypothesized that chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids would impact virus infection; however, the same amount of DENV was produced per cell. This study reveals how Ae. aegypti cells adapt in the absence of vertebrate lipids, and how DENV can replicate equally well in cells that contain predominately vertebrate or invertebrate lipids.

26976324,2016 Mar 15,A generic screening platform for inhibitors of virus induced cell fusion using cellular electrical impedance.,"Fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes is an essential step in the life cycle of all enveloped viruses. Despite such a clear target for antiviral drug development, few anti-fusion drugs have progressed to market. One significant hurdle is the absence of a generic, high-throughput, reproducible fusion assay. Here we report that real time, label-free measurement of cellular electrical impedance can quantify cell-cell fusion mediated by either individually expressed recombinant viral fusion proteins, or native virus infection. We validated this approach for all three classes of viral fusion and demonstrated utility in quantifying fusion inhibition using antibodies and small molecule inhibitors specific for dengue virus and respiratory syncytial virus.

33784371,2021 Mar,Aggressive organ penetration and high vector transmissibility of epidemic dengue virus-2 Cosmopolitan genotype in a transmission mouse model.,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever and severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes. The incidence of DENV infection has been gradually increasing in recent years due to global urbanization and international travel. Understanding the virulence determinants in host and vector transmissibility of emerging epidemic DENV will be critical to combat potential outbreaks. The DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2), which caused a widespread outbreak in Taiwan in 2015 (TW2015), is of the Cosmopolitan genotype and is phylogenetically related to the virus strain linked to another large outbreak in Indonesia in 2015. We found that the TW2015 virus was highly virulent in type I and type II interferon-deficient mice, with robust replication in spleen, lung, and intestine. The TW2015 virus also had high transmissibility to Aedes mosquitoes and could be effectively spread in a continuous mosquitoes-mouse-mosquitoes-mouse transmission cycle. By making 16681-based mutants carrying different segments of the TW2015 virus, we identified the structural pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes as key virulence determinants in the host, with involvement in the high transmissibility of the TW2015 virus in mosquitoes. The transmission mouse model will make a useful platform for evaluation of DENV with high epidemic potential and development of new strategies against dengue outbreaks.

17426882,2007 May,Histopathological and ultrastructural aspects of mice lungs experimentally infected with dengue virus serotype 2.,"Histological and ultrastructural alterations in lung tissue of BALB/c mice infected with dengue virus serotype 2 (non-neuroadapted), by intraperitoneal and intravenous routes were analyzed. Lung tissues were processed following the standard techniques for photonic and electron transmission microscopies. Histopathological and ultrastructural studies showed interstitial pneumonia, characterized by the presence of mononuclear cells. In the mouse model, the dengue virus serotype 2 seems to led to a transient inflammatory process without extensive damage to the interalveolar septa, but caused focal alterations of the blood-exchange barrier. Endothelial cells of blood capillaries exhibited phyllopodia suggesting activation by presence of dengue virus. Morphometrical analysis of mast cells showed an expressive increase of the number of these cells in peribronchiolar spaces and adjacent areas to the interalveolar septa. Alveolar macrophages showed particles dengue virus-like inside rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, suggesting viral replication. The tissue alterations observed in our experimental model were similar to the observed in human cases of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever.

33406991,2021 May,Dengue virus strain 2 capsid protein switches the annealing pathway and reduces intrinsic dynamics of the conserved 5' untranslated region.,"The capsid protein of dengue virus strain 2 (DENV2C) promotes nucleic acid structural rearrangements using chaperone activity. However, the role of DENV2C during the interaction of RNA elements in the conserved 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) is still unclear. Thus, we investigated the effect of DENV2C on the annealing mechanism of two RNA hairpin elements from the 5'UTR to their complementary sequences during (+)/(-) ds-RNAformation and (+) RNA circularization. DENV2C was found to switch the annealing pathway for RNA elements involved in (+)/(-) ds-RNA formation, but not for RNA elements related to (+) RNA circularization. In addition, we also determined that DENV2C modulates intrinsic dynamics and reduces kinetically trapped unfavourable conformations of the 5'UTR sequence. Thus, our results provide mechanistic insights by which DENV2C chaperones the interactions between RNA elements at the 5' and 3' ends during genome recombination, a prerequisite for DENV replication.

24339931,2013,Intracellular nucleic acid delivery by the supercharged dengue virus capsid protein.,"Supercharged proteins are a recently identified class of proteins that have the ability to efficiently deliver functional macromolecules into mammalian cells. They were first developed as bioengineering products, but were later found in the human proteome. In this work, we show that this class of proteins with unusually high net positive charge is frequently found among viral structural proteins, more specifically among capsid proteins. In particular, the capsid proteins of viruses from the Flaviviridae family have all a very high net charge to molecular weight ratio (> +1.07/kDa), thus qualifying as supercharged proteins. This ubiquity raises the hypothesis that supercharged viral capsid proteins may have biological roles that arise from an intrinsic ability to penetrate cells. Dengue virus capsid protein was selected for a detailed experimental analysis. We showed that this protein is able to deliver functional nucleic acids into mammalian cells. The same result was obtained with two isolated domains of this protein, one of them being able to translocate lipid bilayers independently of endocytic routes. Nucleic acids such as siRNA and plasmids were delivered fully functional into cells. The results raise the possibility that the ability to penetrate cells is part of the native biological functions of some viral capsid proteins.

26512092,2016 Jan 15,Dengue Virus prM-Specific Human Monoclonal Antibodies with Virus Replication-Enhancing Properties Recognize a Single Immunodominant Antigenic Site.,"The proposed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism for severe dengue virus (DENV) disease suggests that non-neutralizing serotype cross-reactive antibodies generated during a primary infection facilitate entry into Fc receptor bearing cells during secondary infection, resulting in enhanced viral replication and severe disease. One group of cross-reactive antibodies that contributes considerably to this serum profile target the premembrane (prM) protein. We report here the isolation of a large panel of naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) obtained from subjects following primary DENV serotype 1, 2, or 3 or secondary natural DENV infections or following primary DENV serotype 1 live attenuated virus vaccination to determine the antigenic landscape on the prM protein that is recognized by human antibodies. We isolated 25 prM-reactive human MAbs, encoded by diverse antibody-variable genes. Competition-binding studies revealed that all of the antibodies bound to a single major antigenic site on prM. Alanine scanning-based shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping studies revealed diverse patterns of fine specificity of various clones, suggesting that different antibodies use varied binding poses to recognize several overlapping epitopes within the immunodominant site. Several of the antibodies interacted with epitopes on both prM and E protein residues. Despite the diverse genetic origins of the antibodies and differences in the fine specificity of their epitopes, each of these prM-reactive antibodies was capable of enhancing the DENV infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. IMPORTANCE: Antibodies may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of enhanced DENV infection and disease during secondary infections. A substantial proportion of enhancing antibodies generated in response to natural dengue infection are directed toward the prM protein. The fine specificity of human prM antibodies is not understood. Here, we isolated a panel of dengue prM-specific human monoclonal antibodies from individuals after infection in order to define the mode of molecular recognition by enhancing antibodies. We found that only a single antibody molecule can be bound to each prM protein at any given time. Distinct overlapping epitopes were mapped, but all of the epitopes lie within a single major antigenic site, suggesting that this antigenic domain forms an immunodominant region of the protein. Neutralization and antibody-dependent enhanced replication experiments showed that recognition of any of the epitopes within the major antigenic site on prM was sufficient to cause enhanced infection of target cells.

The infection and dissemination rate and distribution of DEN2-43 antigens in orally infected Ae. albopictus was investigated using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. To better understand the initial infection, dissemination and transmission of these viral strains in vector mosquitoes, Ae. albopoictus and Ae. aegypti were fed an artificial blood meal containing either the DEN2-43 or NGC strain. There was no significant difference in the infection and dissemination rates of DEN2-43 and NGC virus strains in Ae. albopictus, however, Ae. aegypti was more susceptible to infection by NGC than DEN2-43 vrius strain. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes infected with the NGC strain developed a higher percentage of midgut infections than those infected with the DEN2-43 strain (t=2.893, df=7, P=0.024). Approximately 26.7% of midgut samples were positive for the NGC antigen 5 days after infection, and 80% of mosquitoes had infected midgets after 15 days. The NGC antigen first became evident in mosquito salivary glands on Day 5, and 40% of mosquitoes had infected salivary by Day 9. In contrast, the DEN2-43 antigen first became evident in salivary glands on Day 7. The infection rate of NGC and DEN2-43 virus strains in salivary glands were similar.

To study the flanking sequences required for expression of the dengue virus nonstructural glycoprotein NS1, we constructed a series of recombinant vaccinia viruses that contain the coding sequence for NS1 in combination with various lengths of upstream and downstream sequences. The NS1 products expressed by these viruses in infected CV-1 cells were immune precipitated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The data show that the 24-residue hydrophobic sequence preceding NS1 was necessary and sufficient for the production of glycosylated NS1 and that this sequence was cleaved from NS1 in the absence of most dengue virus proteins. This finding is consistent with previous proposals that this hydrophobic sequence serves as an N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved by signal peptidase. The cleavage between the C terminus of NS1 and the downstream protein NS2a occurred when the complete NS2a was present. Recombinant viruses containing NS1 plus 15 or 49% of NS2a produced proteins larger than authentic NS1, indicating that the cleavage between NS1 and NS2a had not occurred. Failure of cleavage was not corrected by coinfection with a recombinant virus capable of cleavage. These results suggest that NS2a may be a cis-acting protease that cleaves itself from NS1, or NS2a may provide sequences for recognition by a specific cellular protease that cleaves at the NS1-NS2a junction.

21566267,2011 May 12,Small molecule pan-dengue and West Nile virus NS3 protease inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome are caused by infections with any of the four serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV), and are an increasing global health risk. The related West Nile virus (WNV) causes significant morbidity and mortality as well, and continues to be a threat in endemic areas. Currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics are available to prevent or treat any of these infections. Like the other members of Flaviviridae, DENV and WNV encode a protease (NS3) which is essential for viral replication and therefore is a promising target for developing therapies to treat dengue and West Nile infections. METHODS: Flaviviral protease inhibitors were identified and biologically characterized for mechanism of inhibition and DENV antiviral activity. RESULTS: A guanidinylated 2,5-dideoxystreptamine class of compounds was identified that competitively inhibited the NS3 protease from DENV(1-4) and WNV with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the 1-70 μM range. Cytotoxicity was low; however, antiviral activity versus DENV-2 on VERO cells was not detectable. CONCLUSIONS: This class of compounds is the first to demonstrate competitive pan-dengue and WNV NS3 protease inhibition and, given the sequence conservation among flavivirus NS3 proteins, suggests that developing a pan-dengue or possibly pan-flavivirus therapeutic is feasible.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/enzymology/isolation & purification', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Structure', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protease Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA Helicases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'West Nile virus/*drug effects/enzymology/isolation & purification']","['BACKGROUND: Dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome are caused by infections with any of the four serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV), and are an increasing global health risk.', 'The related West Nile virus (WNV) causes significant morbidity and mortality as well, and continues to be a threat in endemic areas.', 'Currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics are available to prevent or treat any of these infections.', 'Like the other members of Flaviviridae, DENV and WNV encode a protease (NS3) which is essential for viral replication and therefore is a promising target for developing therapies to treat dengue and West Nile infections.', 'METHODS: Flaviviral protease inhibitors were identified and biologically characterized for mechanism of inhibition and DENV antiviral activity.', 'RESULTS: A guanidinylated 2,5-dideoxystreptamine class of compounds was identified that competitively inhibited the NS3 protease from DENV(1-4) and WNV with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the 1-70 μM range.', 'Cytotoxicity was low; however, antiviral activity versus DENV-2 on VERO cells was not detectable.', 'CONCLUSIONS: This class of compounds is the first to demonstrate competitive pan-dengue and WNV NS3 protease inhibition and, given the sequence conservation among flavivirus NS3 proteins, suggests that developing a pan-dengue or possibly pan-flavivirus therapeutic is feasible.']"

In 2011, dengue outbreaks occurred in Mandera in northern Kenya and subsequently in Mombasa city along the Kenyan coast in 2013-2014. Following laboratory confirmation of dengue fever cases, an entomologic investigation was conducted to establish the mosquito species, and densities, causing the outbreak. Affected parts of the city were identified with the help of public health officials. Adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected using various tools, processed and screened for dengue virus (DENV) by cell culture and RT-PCR. All containers in every accessible house and compound within affected suburbs were inspected for immatures. A total of 2,065 Ae. aegypti adults were collected and 192 houses and 1,676 containers inspected. An overall house index of 22%, container index, 31.0% (indoor = 19; outdoor = 43) and Breteau index, 270.1, were observed, suggesting that the risk of dengue transmission was high. Overall, jerry cans were the most productive containers (18%), followed by drums (17%), buckets (16%), tires (14%) and tanks (10%). However, each site had specific most-productive container-types such as tanks (17%) in Kizingo; Drums in Nyali (30%) and Changamwe (33%), plastic basins (35%) in Nyali-B and plastic buckets (81%) in Ganjoni. We recommend that for effective control of the dengue vector in Mombasa city, all container types would be targeted. Measures would include proper covering of water storage containers and eliminating discarded containers outdoors through a public participatory environmental clean-up exercise. Providing reliable piped water to all households would minimize the need for water storage and reduce aquatic habitats.

This presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts. The dengue virus 2 (DENV2) - encoded protease cleaves human STING, reducing type I interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans. We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species. The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species. Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded 'RG' renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage.

9574674,1998 May,Immunoglobulin A-specific capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of dengue fever.,"Dengue fever (DF) is usually diagnosed by testing for dengue virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) by a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (MAC-ELISA). However, IgM can last for months, and its presence might reflect a previous infection. We have tested the use of anti-dengue virus IgA capture ELISA (AAC-ELISA) for the diagnosis of DF by comparing the results of MAC-ELISAs and AAC-ELISAs for 178 serum samples taken from patients with confirmed cases of DF. IgM appears more rapidly (mean delay of positivity, 3.8 days after the onset of DF) than IgA (4.6 days) but lasts longer; the peak IgA titer is obtained on day 8. The specificity and the positive predictive value of AAC-ELISA are 100%; its sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) are also 100% between days 6 and 25 after the onset of DF, but they decrease drastically when data for tests conducted with specimens from the first days of infection are included, because the IgA titers, like the IgM titers, have not yet risen.

In Africa in general, and in Angola in particular, the epidemiology and public health impact of DENV is far from clear. However, rapid population growth, unplanned urbanization, increased international travel, and the presence of virus major vector (Aedes aegypti) in the country suggest that DENV transmission may occur. METHODOLOGY: In parallel to the occurrence of a dengue outbreak affecting the capital of Angola, between March and July 2013 four Portuguese institutions diagnosed dengue infection in 146 individuals returning to Portugal. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and molecular analyses of partial viral genomic segments were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the individuals included in this study was 42 years old, the majority being men of Portuguese nationality, reporting various lengths of stay in Angola. Fever was the most reported clinical sign, being frequently associated (61.0%) with myalgia and headache. Hematological values, including hematocrit, white-blood cell and platelets counts, correlated with the absence of severe or complicated cases, or coagulation disorders. No deaths were observed. Viral NS1 was detected in 56.2% of the samples, and all NS1 negative cases had anti-dengue IgM antibodies.

They consist of ∼70 viruses with almost half of them causing human diseases with unspecified febrile illnesses. Cities in western Saudi Arabia are endemic for viruses (DENV) with sporadic infections due to Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). They also represent a major destination for travelers coming for annual religious pilgrimages (Hajj and Umrah) from all over the world. However, whether other flaviviruses are circulating is not known because of the limited number of surveillance studies. Here, we retrospectively screened 690 samples for flaviviruses in samples from patients with unexplained febrile illnesses between 2010 and 2015 in western Saudi Arabia using a pan-flaviviruses RT-PCR assay. Despite Zika virus RNA was not detected, this study confirms circulation and/or sporadic spread of DENV-2, DENV-3, and AHFV, higher prevalence of DENV-2, and a role for visitors from DENV endemic countries in DENV importation into the Kingdom. Further analysis also showed very low genetic diversity of AHFV confirming its slow microevolution. Accordingly, continuous and prospective surveillance for flaviviruses using such assay are warranted in Saudi Arabia which receives millions of Muslims annually to implement effective control measures in light of the global widespread and outbreaks of several flaviviruses.

25078693,2014 Oct,Combined effects of the structural heterogeneity and dynamics of flaviviruses on antibody recognition.,"Flaviviruses are thought to sample an ensemble of structures at equilibrium. One consequence of a structurally dynamic virion is the observed time-dependent increases in neutralization sensitivity that can occur after prolonged incubation with antibody. Differences in how virus strains ""breathe"" may affect epitope exposure and contribute to the underlying mechanisms of strain-dependent neutralization sensitivity. Beyond the contribution of structural dynamics, flaviviruses exist as a structurally heterogeneous population due to an inefficient virion maturation process. Here, we investigate the interplay between virion maturation and structural dynamics that contributes to antibody-mediated neutralization. Using West Nile (WNV) and dengue (DENV) viruses produced under conditions that modify the extent of virion maturation, we investigated time-dependent changes in neutralization sensitivity associated with structural dynamics. Our results identify distinct patterns of neutralization against viruses that vary markedly with respect to the extent of virion maturation. Reducing the efficiency of virion maturation resulted in greater time-dependent changes in neutralization potency and a marked reduction in the stability of the particle at 37°C compared to more mature virus. The fact that the neutralization sensitivity of WNV and DENV did not increase after prolonged incubation in the absence of antibody, regardless of virion maturation, suggests that the dynamic processes that govern epitope accessibility on infectious viruses are reversible. Against the backdrop of heterogeneous flavivirus structures, differences in the pathways by which viruses ""breathe"" represent an additional layer of complexity in understanding maturation state-dependent patterns of antibody recognition. Importance: Flaviviruses exist as a group of related structures at equilibrium that arise from the dynamic motion of E proteins that comprise the antigenic surface of the mature virion. This process has been characterized for numerous viruses and is referred to as viral ""breathing."" Additionally, flaviviruses are structurally heterogeneous due to an inefficient maturation process responsible for cleaving prM on the virion surface. Both of these mechanisms vary the exposure of antigenic sites available for antibody binding and impact the ability of antibodies to neutralize infection. We demonstrate that virions with inefficient prM cleavage ""breathe"" differently than their more mature counterparts, resulting in distinct patterns of neutralization sensitivity. Additionally, the maturation state was found to impact virus stability in solution. Our findings provide insight into the complex flavivirus structures that contribute to infection with the potential to impact antibody recognition.

24984164,2014 Sep,NS1-based tests with diagnostic utility for confirming dengue infection: a meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-based tests may offer a larger window of opportunity for dengue diagnosis and could constitute a very useful diagnostic tool. The aim of this study was to establish the overall accuracy of NS1-based tests for diagnosing dengue infection. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted including 18 studies published up to October 1, 2012 identified using PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database. RESULTS: For the single NS1-based tests - ELISA (Panbio Dengue Early ELISA Kit, Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA Kit, and Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag-ELISA Kit) and immunochromatography (Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP Kit and SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo Strip Kit) - the summarized sensitivities and specificities were 67% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59-74%) and 99% (95% CI 97-99%), and 71% (95% CI 61-79%) and 99% (95% CI 98-100%), respectively. The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROCs) were 0.92 and 0.96, respectively. For NS1 combined with an anti-dengue-specific IgM test, the summarized sensitivity, specificity, and HSROC were 83% (95% CI 68-92%), 86% (95% CI 79-91%), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.93), respectively. The accuracy for serotypes was 50.0-90.9% for DENV-1, 38.5-85.7% for DENV-2, 46.7-91.3% for DENV-3, and 21.7-87.0% for DENV-4. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the use of single NS1-based tests; they have good diagnostic utility for confirming dengue and for distinguishing serotypes DENV-1 and 3 from DENV-2 and 4, while they can be used as a screening tool when combined with an IgM test. Moreover, the Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP Kit appears to be the best for confirming and serotyping dengue infection.

Not only for diagnostic purpose, the protein had important role in vaccine design as well, as a candidate for studying virus assembly and maturation. Various researchers employed different expression systems and strategies for recombinant NS1 protein production. Attempts to express NS1 protein in prokaryotic and yeast expression system result in formation of insoluble protein which needs to undergo refolding to attain native structural and functional forms. Here, we report the production of soluble NS1 protein in E. coli by using appropriate vector and employing suitable culture conditions to maximize protein production. Proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis reveal the native structure of NS1 protein. Solid phase ELISA using the recombinantly expressed antigen with positive and negative dengue samples showed that the expressed protein retains its antigenic and immunological properties. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the successful production of functionally active recombinant dengue-2 NS1 protein production without undergoing any in vitro posttranslational modification process. 024, India.","['Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification']","['Detection of nonstructural protein (NS1) is an important diagnostic marker during acute phase of dengue infection.', 'Not only for diagnostic purpose, the protein had important role in vaccine design as well, as a candidate for studying virus assembly and maturation.', 'Various researchers employed different expression systems and strategies for recombinant NS1 protein production.', 'Attempts to express NS1 protein in prokaryotic and yeast expression system result in formation of insoluble protein which needs to undergo refolding to attain native structural and functional forms.', 'Here, we report the production of soluble NS1 protein in E. coli by using appropriate vector and employing suitable culture conditions to maximize protein production.', 'Proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography.', 'SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis reveal the native structure of NS1 protein.', 'Solid phase ELISA using the recombinantly expressed antigen with positive and negative dengue samples showed that the expressed protein retains its antigenic and immunological properties.', 'To our knowledge, this is the first report on the successful production of functionally active recombinant dengue-2 NS1 protein production without undergoing any in vitro posttranslational modification process. 024, India.']"
35215929,2022 Feb 7,In Vitro Inhibition of Replication of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1-4 by siRNAs Bound to Non-Toxic Liposomes.,"Dengue virus is a ssRNA+ flavivirus, which produces the dengue disease in humans. Currently, no specific treatment exists. siRNAs regulate gene expression and have been used systematically to silence viral genomes; however, they require controlled release. Liposomes show favorable results encapsulating siRNA for gene silencing. The objective herein was to design and evaluate in vitro siRNAs bound to liposomes that inhibit DENV replication. siRNAs were designed against DENV1-4 from conserved regions using siDirect2.0 and Web-BLOCK-iT™ RNAiDesigner; the initial in vitro evaluation was carried out through transfection into HepG2 cells. siRNA with silencing capacity was encapsulated in liposomes composed of D-Lin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, Chol. Cytotoxicity, hemolysis, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and antiviral activity were evaluated using plaque assay and RT-qPCR. A working concentration of siRNA was established at 40 nM. siRNA1, siRNA2, siRNA3.1, and siRNA4 were encapsulated in liposomes, and their siRNA delivery through liposomes led to a statistically significant decrease in viral titers, yielded no cytotoxicity or hemolysis and did not stimulate release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, liposomes were designed with siRNA against DENV, which proved to be safe in vitro. Quindío, Armenia 630003, Colombia.

21410643,2011 May,PCR detection of nearly any dengue virus strain using a highly sensitive primer 'cocktail'.,"PCR detection of viral pathogens is extremely useful, but suffers from the challenge of detecting the many variant strains of a given virus that arise over time. Here, we report the computational derivation and initial experimental testing of a combination of 10 PCR primers to be used in a single high-sensitivity mixed PCR reaction for the detection of dengue virus. Primer sequences were computed such that their probability of mispriming with human DNA is extremely low. A 'cocktail' of 10 primers was shown experimentally to be able to detect cDNA clones representing the four serotypes and dengue virus RNA spiked into total human whole blood RNA. Computationally, the primers are predicted to detect 95% of the 1688 dengue strains analyzed (with perfect primer match). Allowing up to one mismatch and one insertion per primer, the primer set detects 99% of strains. Primer sets from three previous studies have been compared with the present set of primers and their relative sensitivity for dengue virus is discussed. These results provide the formulation and demonstration of a mixed primer PCR reagent that may enable the detection of nearly any dengue strain irrespective of serotype, in a single PCR reaction, and illustrate an approach to the broad problem of detecting highly mutable RNA viruses.

25980035,2015 Dec 1,Human CD8+ T-Cell Responses Against the 4 Dengue Virus Serotypes Are Associated With Distinct Patterns of Protein Targets.,"BACKGROUND: All 4 dengue virus (DENV) serotypes are now simultaneously circulating worldwide and responsible for up to 400 million human infections each year. Previous studies of CD8(+) T-cell responses in HLA-transgenic mice and human vaccinees demonstrated that the hierarchy of immunodominance among structural versus nonstructural proteins differs as a function of the infecting serotype. This led to the hypothesis that there are intrinsic differences in the serotype-specific reactivity of CD8(+) T-cell responses. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis by analyzing serotype-specific CD8(+) T-cell reactivity in naturally infected human donors from Sri Lanka and Nicaragua, using ex vivo interferon γ-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. RESULTS: Remarkably similar and clear serotype-specific patterns of immunodominance in both cohorts were identified. Pooling of epitopes that accounted for 90% of the interferon γ response in both cohorts resulted in a global epitope pool. Its reactivity was confirmed in naturally infected donors from Brazil, demonstrating its global applicability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into differential serotype-specific immunogenicity of DENV proteins. It further provides a potentially valuable tool for future investigations of CD8(+) T-cell responses in the typically small sample volumes available from patients with acute fever and children without requiring prior knowledge of either infecting DENV serotype or HLA type.

30016491,2018 Aug 1,"Implementing a dengue vaccination programme-who, where and how?","The complex interaction between dengue viruses and the human immune system means that development of a safe, effective dengue vaccine was never going to be simple. The only currently licenced dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia®) does, indeed, have a complex immune profile depending on recipients' immune status, meaning that use of this vaccine is not straightforward. This commentary reviews the recommendations for vaccine use to date, and discusses issues and opportunities related to the implementation of vaccination programmes in light of these recommendations.

17301146,2007 May,Crystal structure of the dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalytic domain at 1.85-angstrom resolution.,"Dengue fever, a neglected emerging disease for which no vaccine or antiviral agents exist at present, is caused by dengue virus, a member of the Flavivirus genus, which includes several important human pathogens, such as yellow fever and West Nile viruses. The NS5 protein from dengue virus is bifunctional and contains 900 amino acids. The S-adenosyl methionine transferase activity resides within its N-terminal domain, and residues 270 to 900 form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalytic domain. Viral replication begins with the synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the dengue virus positive-strand RNA genome, which is subsequently used as a template for synthesizing additional plus-strand RNA genomes. This essential function for the production of new viral particles is catalyzed by the NS5 RdRp. Here we present a high-throughput in vitro assay partly recapitulating this activity and the crystallographic structure of an enzymatically active fragment of the dengue virus RdRp refined at 1.85-A resolution. The NS5 nuclear localization sequences, previously thought to fold into a separate domain, form an integral part of the polymerase subdomains. The structure also reveals the presence of two zinc ion binding motifs. In the absence of a template strand, a chain-terminating nucleoside analogue binds to the priming loop site. These results should inform and accelerate the structure-based design of antiviral compounds against dengue virus.

28531223,2017 May,Dengue in Bali: Clinical characteristics and genetic diversity of circulating dengue viruses.,"A high number of dengue cases are reported annually in Bali. Despite the endemicity, limited data on dengue is available for Bali localities. Molecular surveillance study was conducted to explore the clinical and virological characteristics of dengue patients in urban Denpasar and rural Gianyar areas in Bali during the peak season in 2015. A total of 205 adult dengue-suspected patients were recruited in a prospective cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical information were obtained, and dengue screening was performed using NS1 and IgM/IgG ELISAs. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from patients' sera for serotyping using conventional RT-PCR and Simplexa Dengue real-time RT-PCR, followed by genotyping with sequencing method. We confirmed 161 patients as having dengue by NS1 and RT-PCR. Among 154 samples successfully serotyped, the DENV-3 was predominant, followed by DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4. Serotype predominance was different between Denpasar and Gianyar. Genotyping results classify DENV-1 isolates into Genotype I and DENV-2 as Cosmopolitan Genotype. The classification grouped isolates into Genotype I and II for DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Clinical parameters showed no relationship between infecting serotypes and severity. We observed the genetic diversity of circulating DENV isolates and their relatedness with historical data and importation to other countries.

29735824,2018 Jan-Mar,"Molecular characterisation and phylogenetic analysis of dengue outbreak in Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dengue is one of the most prevalent arboviral diseases in the world with 390 million dengue infections per year. In this study, we report the molecular characterisation of dengue outbreak in Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India during 2015. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: : A total of 613 dengue-suspected cases were screened for dengue virus by dengue NS1 Ag and anti-dengue IgM antibody depending on the duration of sample collection and onset of symptom. Further, molecular characterisation was done by amplifying the C-PrM region by real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Molecular characterisation revealed that the dengue outbreak was predominantly due to dengue virus serotype-1 (DENV-1) (90.9%) while DENV-2 was detected in 7.5% of samples. Co-infection of DENV-1 and DENV-2 was detected in one case. Phylogenetic analysis of the DENV-1 strains with the prototype revealed that the DENV-1 strains were grouped within genotype III. Similarly, DENV-2 strains were clustered within genotype IV. The study revealed a change in the predominant serotype in recent years with DENV-3 in 2012 to DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4 in 2014 to DENV-1 in 2015 in the study region. A unique L24M mutation was observed in the DENV-1 strains of Arunachal Pradesh which was absent in all the circulating strains in India except one strain from the state of Kerala in South India. Marked variation within the DENV-2 strains was observed at A102V and I163V in one strain similar to earlier circulating isolates in India. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals a shift in the serotype dominance in the study region. As serotype shifts and secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype are frequently associated with disease severity, there is an urgent need for sustained monitoring of the circulating serotypes and enhanced surveillance operations, especially in the monsoon and post-monsoon periods to prevent large-scale, severe dengue outbreaks in this region.

27267473,2016 Jun 6,Isolation of dengue virus serotype 4 genotype II from a patient with high viral load and a mixed Th1/Th17 inflammatory cytokine profile in South Brazil.,"BACKGROUND: We report the isolation and characterization of dengue virus (DENV) serotype 4 from a resident of Santa Fé, state of Paraná, South Brazil, in March 2013. This patient presented with hemorrhagic manifestations, high viral load and, interestingly, a mixed Th1/Th17 cytokine profile. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with classical dengue symptoms, such as fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and hemorrhagic manifestations including petechiae, gum bleeding and a positive tourniquet test result. A serum sample obtained 1 day after the initial appearance of clinical symptoms was positive for NS1 viral antigen, but this sample was negative for both IgM and IgG against DENV. Dengue virus infection was confirmed by isolation of the virus from C6/36 cells, and dengue virus serotyping was performed via one-step RT-PCR. The infection was confirmed to be caused by a serotype 4 dengue virus. Additionally, based on multiple alignment and phylogeny analyses of its complete genome sequence, the viral strain was classified as genotype II (termed LRV13/422). Moreover, a mixed Th1/Th17 cytokine profile was detected in the patient's serum, and this result demonstrated significant inflammation. Biological characterization of the virus via in vitro assays comparing LRV13/422 with a laboratory-adapted reference strain of dengue virus serotype 4 (TVP/360) showed that LRV13/422 infects both vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines more efficiently than TVP/360. However, LRV13/422 was unable to inhibit type I interferon responses, as suggested by the results obtained for other dengue virus strains. Furthermore, LRV13/422 is the first completely sequenced serotype 4 dengue virus isolated in South Brazil. CONCLUSION: The high viral load and mixed Th1/Th17 cytokine profile observed in the patient's serum could have implications for the development of the hemorrhagic signs observed, and these potential relationships can now be further studied using suitable animal models and/or in vitro systems.

23755311,2013,Replacing a native Wolbachia with a novel strain results in an increase in endosymbiont load and resistance to dengue virus in a mosquito vector.,"Wolbachia is a maternally transmitted endosymbiotic bacterium that is estimated to infect up to 65% of insect species. The ability of Wolbachia to both induce pathogen interference and spread into mosquito vector populations makes it possible to develop Wolbachia as a biological control agent for vector-borne disease control. Although Wolbachia induces resistance to dengue virus (DENV), filarial worms, and Plasmodium in mosquitoes, species like Aedes polynesiensis and Aedes albopictus, which carry native Wolbachia infections, are able to transmit dengue and filariasis. In a previous study, the native wPolA in Ae. polynesiensis was replaced with wAlbB from Ae. albopictus, and resulted in the generation of the transinfected ""MTB"" strain with low susceptibility for filarial worms. In this study, we compare the dynamics of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) within the wild type ""APM"" strain and the MTB strain of Ae. polynesiensis by measuring viral infection in the mosquito whole body, midgut, head, and saliva at different time points post infection. The results show that wAlbB can induce a strong resistance to DENV-2 in the MTB mosquito. Evidence also supports that this resistance is related to a dramatic increase in Wolbachia density in the MTB's somatic tissues, including the midgut and salivary gland. Our results suggests that replacement of a native Wolbachia with a novel infection could serve as a strategy for developing a Wolbachia-based approach to target naturally infected insects for vector-borne disease control.

26403837,2015 Dec,Secondary structure and membrane topology of dengue virus NS4B N-terminal 125 amino acids.,"The transmembrane NS4B protein of dengue virus (DENV) is a validated antiviral target that plays important roles in viral replication and invasion of innate immune response. The first 125 amino acids of DENV NS4B are sufficient for inhibition of alpha/beta interferon signaling. Resistance mutations to NS4B inhibitors are all mapped to the first 125 amino acids. In this study, we expressed and purified a protein representing the first 125 amino acids of NS4B (NS4B(1-125)). This recombinant NS4B(1-125) protein was reconstituted into detergent micelles. Solution NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that there are five helices (α1 to α5) present in NS4B(1-125). Dynamic studies, together with a paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiment demonstrated that four helices, α2, α3, α4, and α5 are embedded in the detergent micelles. Comparison of wild type and V63I mutant (a mutation that confers resistance to NS4B inhibitor) NS4B(1-125) proteins demonstrated that V63I mutation did not cause significant conformational changes, however, V63 may have a molecular interaction with residues in the α5 transmembrane domain under certain conditions.

34681671,2021 Oct 12,Sulfonated and Carboxymethylated β-Glucan Derivatives with Inhibitory Activity against Herpes and Dengue Viruses.,"The infection of mammalian cells by enveloped viruses is triggered by the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate. By mimicking this carbohydrate, some anionic polysaccharides can block this interaction and inhibit viral entry and infection. As heparan sulfate carries both carboxyl and sulfate groups, this work focused on the derivatization of a (1→3)(1→6)-β-D-glucan, botryosphaeran, with these negatively-charged groups in an attempt to improve its antiviral activity. Carboxyl and sulfonate groups were introduced by carboxymethylation and sulfonylation reactions, respectively. Three derivatives with the same degree of carboxymethylation (0.9) and different degrees of sulfonation (0.1; 0.2; 0.4) were obtained. All derivatives were chemically characterized and evaluated for their antiviral activity against herpes (HSV-1, strains KOS and AR) and dengue (DENV-2) viruses. Carboxymethylated botryosphaeran did not inhibit the viruses, while all sulfonated-carboxymethylated derivatives were able to inhibit HSV-1. DENV-2 was inhibited only by one of these derivatives with an intermediate degree of sulfonation (0.2), demonstrating that the dengue virus is more resistant to anionic β-D-glucans than the Herpes simplex virus. By comparison with a previous study on the antiviral activity of sulfonated botryosphaerans, we conclude that the presence of carboxymethyl groups might have a detrimental effect on antiviral activity.

17192403,2007 Feb,"Two complex, adenovirus-based vaccines that together induce immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes.","Dengue virus infections can cause hemorrhagic fever, shock, encephalitis, and even death. Worldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-infested regions with about 100 million new cases each year, although many of these infections are believed to be silent. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus; thus, immunity from one serotype will not cross-protect from infection with the other three. The difficulties that hamper vaccine development include requirements of the natural conformation of the envelope glycoprotein to induce neutralizing immune responses and the necessity of presenting antigens of all four serotypes. Currently, the only way to meet these requirements is to use a mixture of four serotypes of live attenuated dengue viruses, but safety remains a major problem. In this study, we have developed the basis for a tetravalent dengue vaccine using a novel complex adenovirus platform that is capable of expressing multiple antigens de novo. This dengue vaccine is constructed as a pair of vectors that each expresses the premembrane and envelope genes of two different dengue virus serotypes. Upon vaccination, the vaccine expressed high levels of the dengue virus antigens in cells to mimic a natural infection and induced both humoral and cellular immune responses against multiple serotypes of dengue virus in an animal model. Further analyses show the humoral responses were indeed neutralizing against all four serotypes. Our studies demonstrate the concept of mimicking infections to induce immune responses by synthesizing dengue virus membrane antigens de novo and the feasibility of developing an effective tetravalent dengue vaccine by vector-mediated expression of glycoproteins of the four serotypes.

Codons for 80 contiguous pairs of charged amino acids in NS5 were individually mutagenized to create uncharged pairs of alanine residues, and 32 recombinant mutant viruses were recovered from the 80 full-length mutant DEN4 cDNA constructs. These mutant viruses were tested for temperature-sensitive (ts) replication in both Vero cells and HuH-7 human hepatoma cells. Of the 32 mutants, 13 were temperature sensitive (ts) in both cell lines, 11 were not ts in either cell line, and 8 exhibited a host range (tshr) phenotype. One tshr mutant was ts only in Vero cells, and seven were ts only in HuH-7 cells. Nineteen of the 32 mutants were 10-fold or more restricted in replication in the brains of suckling mice compared to that of wild-type DEN4, and three mutants were approximately 10,000-fold restricted in replication. The level of temperature sensitivity of replication in vitro did not correlate with attenuation in vivo. A virus bearing two pairs of charge-to-alanine mutations was constructed and demonstrated increased temperature sensitivity and attenuation relative to either parent virus.

23028722,2012,A genetic and pathologic study of a DENV2 clinical isolate capable of inducing encephalitis and hematological disturbances in immunocompetent mice.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever (DF), a mosquito-borne illness endemic to tropical and subtropical regions. There is currently no effective drug or vaccine formulation for the prevention of DF and its more severe forms, i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are two generally available experimental models for the study of DENV pathogenicity as well as the evaluation of potential vaccine candidates. The first model consists of non-human primates, which do not develop symptoms but rather a transient viremia. Second, mouse-adapted virus strains or immunocompromised mouse lineages are utilized, which display some of the pathological features of the infection observed in humans but may not be relevant to the results with regard to the wild-type original virus strains or mouse lineages. In this study, we describe a genetic and pathological study of a DENV2 clinical isolate, named JHA1, which is naturally capable of infecting and killing Balb/c mice and reproduces some of the symptoms observed in DENV-infected subjects. Sequence analyses demonstrated that the JHA1 isolate belongs to the American genotype group and carries genetic markers previously associated with neurovirulence in mouse-adapted virus strains. The JHA1 strain was lethal to immunocompetent mice following intracranial (i.c.) inoculation with a LD(50) of approximately 50 PFU. Mice infected with the JHA1 strain lost weight and exhibited general tissue damage and hematological disturbances, with similarity to those symptoms observed in infected humans. In addition, it was demonstrated that the JHA1 strain shares immunological determinants with the DENV2 NGC reference strain, as evaluated by cross-reactivity of anti-envelope glycoprotein (domain III) antibodies. The present results indicate that the JHA1 isolate may be a useful tool in the study of DENV pathogenicity and will help in the evaluation of anti-DENV vaccine formulations as well as potential therapeutic approaches.

12438618,2002 Dec,RNA silencing of dengue virus type 2 replication in transformed C6/36 mosquito cells transcribing an inverted-repeat RNA derived from the virus genome.,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates cellular posttranscriptional responses that are collectively called RNA silencing in a number of different organisms, including plants, nematodes, and fruit flies. In plants, RNA silencing has been associated with protection from virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that dsRNA-mediated interference also can act as a viral defense mechanism in mosquito cells. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells were stably transformed with a plasmid designed to transcribe an inverted-repeat RNA (irRNA) derived from the genome of dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) capable of forming dsRNA. Clonal cell lines were selected with an antibiotic resistance marker and challenged with DEN-2. The cell lines were classified as either susceptible or resistant to virus replication, based on the percentage of cells expressing DEN-2 envelope (E) antigen 7 days after challenge. Eight out of 18 (44%) cell lines designed to express irRNA were resistant to DEN-2 challenge, with more than 95% of the cells showing no DEN-2 antigen accumulation. One of the DEN-2-resistant cell lines, FB 9.1, was further characterized. DEN-2 genome RNA failed to accumulate in FB 9.1 cells after challenge. Northern blot hybridization detected transcripts containing transgene sequences of both sense and antisense polarity, suggesting that DEN-2-specific dsRNA was present in the cells. In addition, a class of small RNAs 21 to 25 nucleotides in length was detected that specifically hybridized to labeled sense or antisense DEN-2 RNA derived from the target region of the genome. These observations were consistent with RNA silencing as the mechanism of resistance to DEN-2 in transformed mosquito cells.

23936406,2013,Inter- and intra-host viral diversity in a large seasonal DENV2 outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: High genetic diversity at both inter- and intra-host level are hallmarks of RNA viruses due to the error-prone nature of their genome replication. Several groups have evaluated the extent of viral variability using different RNA virus deep sequencing methods. Although much of this effort has been dedicated to pathogens that cause chronic infections in humans, few studies investigated arthropod-borne, acute viral infections. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We deep sequenced the complete genome of ten DENV2 isolates from representative classical and severe cases sampled in a large outbreak in Brazil using two different approaches. Analysis of the consensus genomes confirmed the larger extent of the 2010 epidemic in comparison to a previous epidemic caused by the same viruses in another city two years before (genetic distance = 0.002 and 0.0008 respectively). Analysis of viral populations within the host revealed a high level of conservation. After excluding homopolymer regions of 454/Roche generated sequences, we found 10 to 44 variable sites per genome population at a frequency of >1%, resulting in very low intra-host genetic diversity. While up to 60% of all variable sites at intra-host level were non-synonymous changes, only 10% of inter-host variability resulted from non-synonymous mutations, indicative of purifying selection at the population level. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the error-prone nature of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, dengue viruses maintain low levels of intra-host variability. de Moléstias Infecciosas e Parasitárias (LIMHC), Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. cmromano@usp.br","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dengue/epidemiology/genetics/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/*genetics']","['BACKGROUND: High genetic diversity at both inter- and intra-host level are hallmarks of RNA viruses due to the error-prone nature of their genome replication.', 'Several groups have evaluated the extent of viral variability using different RNA virus deep sequencing methods.', 'Although much of this effort has been dedicated to pathogens that cause chronic infections in humans, few studies investigated arthropod-borne, acute viral infections.', 'METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We deep sequenced the complete genome of ten DENV2 isolates from representative classical and severe cases sampled in a large outbreak in Brazil using two different approaches.', 'Analysis of the consensus genomes confirmed the larger extent of the 2010 epidemic in comparison to a previous epidemic caused by the same viruses in another city two years before (genetic distance\u200a=\u200a0.002 and 0.0008 respectively).', 'Analysis of viral populations within the host revealed a high level of conservation.', 'After excluding homopolymer regions of 454/Roche generated sequences, we found 10 to 44 variable sites per genome population at a frequency of >1%, resulting in very low intra-host genetic diversity.', 'While up to 60% of all variable sites at intra-host level were non-synonymous changes, only 10% of inter-host variability resulted from non-synonymous mutations, indicative of purifying selection at the population level.', 'CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the error-prone nature of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, dengue viruses maintain low levels of intra-host variability.', 'de Moléstias Infecciosas e Parasitárias (LIMHC), Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', 'cmromano@usp.br']"

37702492,2023 Oct 31,Dengue virus NS1 secretion is regulated via importin-subunit β1 controlling expression of the chaperone GRp78 and targeted by the clinical drug ivermectin.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a major human pathogen that can cause hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. One important factor of DENV pathogenicity is non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a glycoprotein that is secreted from infected cells. Here we study the mode of action of the widely used drug ivermectin, used to treat parasitic infections and recently shown to lower NS1 blood levels in DENV-infected patients. We found that ivermectin blocks the nuclear transport of transcription factors required for the expression of chaperones that support the folding and secretion of glycoproteins, including NS1. Impairing nuclear transport of these transcription factors by ivermectin or depleting them from infected cells dampens NS1 folding and thus its secretion. These results reveal a novel mode of action of ivermectin that might apply to other flaviviruses as well.

Pretreatment of macrophage cultures with all of test cell walls isolated from seven bacterial species for 3 days significantly enhanced the virus production in the cultures. Peptidoglycans prepared from four of the above cell walls also exerted the virus production-enhancing effects in a similar manner as the walls. A water-soluble polymer of peptidoglycan subunits which was prepared by treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis wall peptidoglycan with an interpeptide bridge-splitting enzyme (endopeptidase) also definitely enhanced the virus production in macrophage cultures, although its activity was weaker than that of the original wall and peptidoglycan. Macrophage cultures from athymic nude mice, when treated with cell walls and peptidoglycans of S. epidermidis and Lactobacillus plantarum for 3 days, also showed an increased ability to support dengue virus type 2 replication. The infectious center assay demonstrated that the virus replication enhancement by S. epidermidis cell wall and peptidoglycan was primarily due to an increase in the number of virus-infected cells. This finding did not seem to be in conflict with the observation that macrophages treated with the above cell wall or peptidoglycan phagocytized more latex particles than did untreated macrophages. The conclusions based on the above experiments are that the treatment of mouse peritoneal macrophage cultures with bacterial cell walls and their components increases the take of dengue virus type 2 by macrophages and thus raises the virus production in the macrophage cultures.","['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cell Wall/physiology', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Peptidoglycan/*pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', '*Staphylococcus', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']","['The effects of bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, and a water-soluble polymer of peptidoglycan subunits on dengue virus type 2 replication in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages were studied.', 'Pretreatment of macrophage cultures with all of test cell walls isolated from seven bacterial species for 3 days significantly enhanced the virus production in the cultures.', 'Peptidoglycans prepared from four of the above cell walls also exerted the virus production-enhancing effects in a similar manner as the walls.', 'A water-soluble polymer of peptidoglycan subunits which was prepared by treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis wall peptidoglycan with an interpeptide bridge-splitting enzyme (endopeptidase) also definitely enhanced the virus production in macrophage cultures, although its activity was weaker than that of the original wall and peptidoglycan.', 'Macrophage cultures from athymic nude mice, when treated with cell walls and peptidoglycans of S. epidermidis and Lactobacillus plantarum for 3 days, also showed an increased ability to support dengue virus type 2 replication.', 'The infectious center assay demonstrated that the virus replication enhancement by S. epidermidis cell wall and peptidoglycan was primarily due to an increase in the number of virus-infected cells.', 'This finding did not seem to be in conflict with the observation that macrophages treated with the above cell wall or peptidoglycan phagocytized more latex particles than did untreated macrophages.', 'The conclusions based on the above experiments are that the treatment of mouse peritoneal macrophage cultures with bacterial cell walls and their components increases the take of dengue virus type 2 by macrophages and thus raises the virus production in the macrophage cultures.']"

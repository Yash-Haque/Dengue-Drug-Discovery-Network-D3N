22624675,Genetic polymorphisms of molecules involved in host immune response to dengue virus infection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22624675/,"Fang X, et al.",,2012,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,"""The dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the flavivirus family. Each of the four distinct serotypes of this virus is capable of causing human disease, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. The majority of people infected with DENV manifest asymptomatic or dengue fever with flu-like self-limited symptoms. However, a small portion of patients emerge with severe manifestations referred to as dengue hemorrhagic fever, which has a high mortality rate if not treated promptly. The host immune system, which plays important roles throughout the whole process of DENV infection, has been confirmed to have double-edged effects on DENV infection. Recently, much attention has been paid to the genetic heterogeneity of molecules involved in the host immune response to DENV infection. This heterogeneity has been proved to be the determining factor for DENV disease orientation. The present review discusses the primary functions and single nucleotide polymorphisms of some critical molecules in the human DENV immunological defense, especially the polymorphism locus associated with the DENV pathogenesis and disease susceptibility."""

It is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viruses, infecting globally 390 million individuals per year. The clinical spectrum of DV infection ranges from an asymptomatic course to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the latter because of severe plasma leakage. Given that the outcome of infection is likely determined by the kinetics of viral replication and the antiviral host cell immune response (HIR) it is of importance to understand the interaction between these two parameters. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to characterize and understand the complex interplay between intracellular DV replication and the host cells' defense mechanisms. We first measured viral RNA, viral protein, and virus particle production in Huh7 cells, which exhibit a notoriously weak intrinsic antiviral response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailed intracellular DV replication model. We then measured replication in IFN competent A549 cells and used this data to couple the replication model with a model describing IFN activation and production of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as their interplay with DV replication. By comparing the cell line specific DV replication, we found that host factors involved in replication complex formation and virus particle production are crucial for replication efficiency. Regarding possible modes of action of the HIR, our model fits suggest that the HIR mainly affects DV RNA translation initiation, cytosolic DV RNA degradation, and naïve cell infection. We further analyzed the potential of direct acting antiviral drugs targeting different processes of the DV lifecyclein silicoand found that targeting RNA synthesis and virus assembly and release are the most promising anti-DV drug targets."""

Infection with one serotype will create neutralizing antibodies to the serotype. Cross-protection from other serotypes is not long term, instead heterotypic infection can cause severe disease. This review will focus on the innate immune response to DENV infection and the virus evasion of the innate immune system by escaping recognition or inhibiting the production of an antiviral state. Activated innate immune pathways includes type I interferon, complement, apoptosis, and autophagy, which the virus can evade or exploit to exacerbate disease.

Owing to the recent emergence of ZIKV as a global pandemic threat, the roles of the immune system during ZIKV infections are as yet unclear. In contrast, decades of DENV research implicate a dual role for the immune system in protection against and pathogenesis of DENV infection. As DENV and ZIKV are closely related, knowledge based on DENV studies has been used to prioritize investigation of ZIKV immunity and pathogenesis, and to accelerate ZIKV diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine design. This review discusses the following topics related to innate and adaptive immune responses to DENV and ZIKV: the interferon system as the key mechanism of host defense and viral target for immune evasion, antibody-mediated protection versus antibody-dependent enhancement, and T cell-mediated protection versus original T cell antigenic sin. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the balance between immune-mediated protection and pathogenesis during DENV and ZIKV infections is critical toward development of safe and effective DENV and ZIKV therapeutics and vaccines."""

The severity of dengue depends on many immunopathogenic mechanisms involving both viral and host factors. Emerging evidence implicates an impaired immune response as contributing to disease progression and severity by restricting viral clearance and inducing severe inflammation, subsequently leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Moreover, the ability of DENV to infect a wide variety of immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and T and B cells, further dysregulates the antiviral functions of these cells, resulting in viral dissemination. Although several risk factors associated with disease progression have been proposed, gaps persist in the understanding of the disease pathogenesis and further investigations are warranted.

Host factors such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), memory cross-reactive T cells, anti-DENV NS1 antibodies, autoimmunity as well as genetic factors are major determinants of disease susceptibility. NS1 protein and anti-DENV NS1 antibodies were believed to be responsible for pathogenesis of severe dengue. The cytokine response of cross-reactive CD4+ T cells might be altered by the sequential infection with different DENV serotypes, leading to further elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributing a detrimental immune response. Fcγ receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) results in release of cytokines from immune cells leading to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and increased vascular permeability. Genomic variation of dengue virus and subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) suppressing host immune response are viral determinants of disease severity. Dengue infection can lead to the generation of autoantibodies against DENV NS1antigen, DENV prM, and E proteins, which can cross-react with several self-antigens such as plasminogen, integrin, and platelet cells. Apart from viral factors, several host genetic factors and gene polymorphisms also have a role to play in pathogenesis of DENV infection.

Individuals with obesity experience an increase in the size and the number of adipocytes, which function as an endocrine organ and release various adipocytokines such as leptin and adiponectin that exert wide ranging effects on other cells. In individuals with obesity, macrophages account for up to 40% of adipose tissue (AT) cells, three times more than in adipose tissue (10%) of healthy weight individuals and secrete several cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, chemokine C-C ligand (CCL)-2, IL-6, CCL5, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leading to the development of inflammation. Overall, obesity-derived cytokines strongly affect immune responses and make patients with obesity more prone to severe symptoms than patients with a healthy weight. Several epidemiological studies reported a strong association between obesity and severe arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) infections such as dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Sindbis virus (SINV). Recently, experimental investigations found that DENV, WNV, CHIKV and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infections cause worsened disease outcomes in infected diet induced obese (DIO) mice groups compared to infected healthy-weight animals. The mechanisms leading to higher susceptibility to severe infections in individuals with obesity remain unknown, though a better understanding of the causes will help scientists and clinicians develop host directed therapies to treat severe disease. In this review article, we summarize the effects of obesity on the host immune response in the context of arboviral infections. We have outlined that obesity makes the host more susceptible to infectious agents, likely by disrupting the functions of innate and adaptive immune cells. We have also discussed the immune response of DIO mouse models against some important arboviruses such as CHIKV, MAYV, DENV, and WNV. We can speculate that obesity-induced disruption of innate and adaptive immune cell function in arboviral infections ultimately affects the course of arboviral disease. Therefore, further studies are needed to explore the cellular and molecular aspects of immunity that are compromised in obesity during arboviral infections or vaccination, which will be helpful in developing specific therapeutic/prophylactic interventions to prevent immunopathology and disease progression in individuals with obesity."""

Attempts to develop vaccines have been variably successful against some. Besides, mosquito-borne flaviviruses can be vertically transmitted in the arthropods, enabling long term persistence and the possibility of re-emergence. Therefore, developing strategies to combat disease is imperative even if vaccines become available. The cellular interactions of flaviviruses with their human hosts are key to establishing the viral lifecycle on the one hand, and activation of host immunity on the other. The latter should ideally eradicate infection, but often leads to immunopathological and neurological consequences.

They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family:Togaviridae,Flaviviridae,Retroviridae,andCoronaviridaesuch as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified.

We propose a within-host mathematical model for the immune response which takes into account the dichotomy between mature infectious and immature noninfectious dengue virions. The model accounts for experimental observations on the different interactions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with infected cells producing virions with different infectivity. We compute the basic reproduction number as a function of the proportion of infected cells producing noninfectious virions and use numerical simulations to compare the host's immune response in a primary and a secondary dengue infections.

The reason for this limited approval is the concern that this vaccine sensitized some of the dengue-naïve recipients to severe dengue fever. Recent knowledge about the nature of the immune response elicited by DENV viruses suggests that all LAVs have inherent capacity to predominantly elicit antibodies (Abs) against the pre-membrane (prM) and fusion loop epitope (FLE) of DENV. These antibodies are generally cross-reactive among DENV serotypes carrying a higher risk of promoting Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE is a phenomenon in which suboptimal neutralizing or non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies bind to virus and facilitate Fcγ receptor mediated enhanced entry into host cells, followed by its replication, and thus increasing the cellular viral load. On the other hand, antibody responses directed against the host-cell receptor binding domain of DENV envelope domain-III (EDIII), exhibit a higher degree of type-specificity with lower potential of ADE. The challenges associated with whole DENV-based vaccine strategies necessitate re-focusing our attention toward the designed dengue vaccine candidates, capable of inducing predominantly type-specific immune responses. If the designed vaccines elicited predominantly EDIII-directed serotype specific antibodies in the absence of prM and FLE antibodies, this could avoid the ADE phenomenon largely associated with the prM and FLE antibodies. The generation of type-specific antibodies to each of the four DENV serotypes by the designed vaccines could avoid the immune evasion mechanisms of DENVs. For the enhanced vaccine safety, all dengue vaccine candidates should be assessed for the extent of type-specific (minimal ADE) vs. cross-reactive (ADE promoting) neutralizing antibodies. The type-specific EDIII antibodies may be more directly related to protection from disease in the absence of ADE promoted by the cross-reactive antibodies."""

The lack of a suitable infection model has hampered dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis study, and developing a suitable small animal model has been a long-standing challenge. The aim of this study was to develop a feasible experimental model of DENV infection using Tupaia belangeri. The susceptibility of tupaia to DENV infection and characteristics of its innate immune response were examined in vitro. We found that tupaia fibroblast cells support replication of DENV serotypes 1-4 with a linear increase in viral load 24-96h post-infection in both cells and culture supernatants. DENV-2 resulted in the highest viral growth among all serotypes. To characterize the innate immune response in tupaia cells during the early phase of DENV infection, we first evaluated the evolutionary relationship between tupaia Toll-like receptors (TLR1-9) and those of other mammalian species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that tupaia TLRs are evolutionarily much closer to human than they are to rodent. We next established an innate immune response measurement system by assessing the mRNA expression of TLR1-9 and four cytokines in DENV-infected tupaia cells. All serotypes induced the upregulation of TLR8 mRNA expression in infected tupaia cells. Silencing of TLR8 led to an increase in viral replication, indicating the existence of antiviral response through TLR8 on DENV infection. Although upregulation of IFN-β and IL-6 expression was only observed in DENV-1 infected cells and a significant suppression of TNF-α was observed in DENV-2 infected cells alone, IL-8 was upregulated in all DENV-1-4. Thus, this study demonstrates for the first time the susceptibility of tupaia cells to DENV infections and the role of TLR8 in the anti-viral response of tupaia cells to DENV. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of tupaia as a model for DENV research in the future."""

Here, we identify a viral mechanism to limit NF-κB activation and cytokine secretion by the DENV protein NS5. Using proteomics, we found that NS5 binds and degrades the host protein ERC1 to antagonize NF-κB activation, limit proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and reduce cell migration. We found that ERC1 degradation involves unique properties of the methyltransferase domain of NS5 that are not conserved among the four DENV serotypes. By obtaining chimeric DENV2 and DENV4 viruses, we map the residues in NS5 for ERC1 degradation, and generate recombinant DENVs exchanging serotype properties by single amino acid substitutions.

The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-DENV4) are spread primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, whose geographic range continues to expand. Humans are the only host for epidemic strains of DENV, and the virus has developed sophisticated mechanisms to evade human innate immune responses. The host cell's first line of defense begins with an intracellular signaling cascade resulting in production of interferon α/β (IFN-α/β), which promotes intracellular antiviral responses and helps initiates the adaptive response during the course of DENV infection. In response, DENV has developed numerous ways to subvert these intracellular antiviral responses and directly inhibit cellular signaling cascades. Specifically, DENV manipulates the unfolded protein response and autophagy to counter cellular stress and delay apoptosis. The DENV non-structural protein NS4B and subgenomic flavivirus RNA interfere with the RNA interference pathway by inhibiting the RNase Dicer. During heterotypic secondary DENV infection, subneutralizing antibodies can enable viral uptake through Fcγ receptors and down-regulate signaling cascades initiated via the pattern recognition receptors TLR-3 and MDA5/RIG-I, thus reducing the antiviral state of the cell. The DENV NS2B/3 protein cleaves human STING/MITA, interfering with induction of IFN-α/β. Finally, DENV NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B complex together to block STAT1 phosphorylation, while NS5 binds and promotes degradation of human STAT2, thus preventing formation of the STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer and its transcriptional induction of interferon stimulating genes.

Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout ofNLRC5led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway.

In most cases, the disease is characterised by fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle ache, joint pains, vomiting and diarrhoea. In a low percentage of patients, bleeding and loss of plasma (haemorrhage and plasma leakage) may occur. The hyper-permeability syndrome results in plasma leakage and, if the compensatory mechanisms of the body fail to control the plasma leakage or if medical intervention is late, shock may set in. Profound shock will subsequently lead to acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) and development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). During DIC multiple micro thromboses occur, leading to organ failure. The mechanisms governing pathogenesis of these forms of severe disease are not clear. High amounts of virus in the blood are believed to cause vascular fragility which, together with infection of endothelial cells and high levels of cytokines and other soluble mediators, may result in bleeding. In the absence of a correlation between the amount of virus in the blood and disease severity, it is likely that response to infection is an important cause of disease. The aberrant immune response to infection is believed to result in a cytokine storm, defined as an imbalance between cytokines driving an inflammation (pro-inflammatory) and those silencing an inflammation (anti-inflammatory).

Our multi-layered immune profiling revealed that sero-positive subjects have increased baseline/pre-vaccination frequencies of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC. Importantly, this baseline/pre-vaccination cTfh profile correlated with the vaccinees' ability to launch neutralizing antibody response against all four sero-types of Dengue virus, an important endpoint for Dengue vaccine clinical trials. Overall, we provide novel insights into the favorable cTfh related immune status that persists in Dengue virus sero-positive individuals that correlate with their ability to mount robust vaccine specific immune responses. Such detailed interrogation of cTfh cell biology in the context of clinical vaccinology will help uncover mechanisms and targets for favorable immuno-modulatory agents."""

Hematophagous mosquito saliva is a mixture of bioactive components known to modulate vertebrate hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation during the insect's feeding process. The capacity of mosquito saliva to modulate the host immune response has been well-studied over the last few decades and has led to the consensus that the presence of saliva is linked to the enhancement of virus transmission, host susceptibility, disease progression, viremia levels, and mortality.

Although prior infection with another viral serotype, i.e. secondary dengue, is known to be an important factor influencing disease severity, current methods to determine primary versus secondary immune status during the acute illness do not consider the rapidly evolving immune response, and their accuracy has rarely been evaluated against an independent gold standard.Methods:Two hundred and ninety-three confirmed dengue patients were classified as experiencing primary, secondary or indeterminate infections using plaque reduction neutralisation tests performed 6 months after resolution of the acute illness. We developed and validated regression models to differentiate primary from secondary dengue on multiple acute illness days, using Panbio Indirect IgG and in-house capture IgG and IgM ELISA measurements performed on over 1000 serial samples obtained during acute illness.Results:Cut-offs derived for the various parameters demonstrated progressive change (positively or negatively) by day of illness. Using these time varying cut-offs it was possible to determine whether an infection was primary or secondary on single specimens, with acceptable performance. The model using Panbio Indirect IgG responses and including an interaction with illness day showed the best performance throughout, although with some decline in performance later in infection. Models based on in-house capture IgG levels, and the IgM/IgG ratio, also performed well, though conversely performance improved later in infection.Conclusions:For all assays, the best fitting models estimated a different cut-off value for different days of illness, confirming how rapidly the immune response changes during acute dengue. The optimal choice of assay will vary depending on circumstance. Although the Panbio Indirect IgG model performs best early on, the IgM/IgG capture ratio may be preferred later in the illness course."""

The number of days of illness is important to choose the most appropriate method to be used and for the correct interpretation of the results obtained. Specific IgM is elicited after that period, indicating an active infection and usually lasts up to 3 months. However, in DENV secondary infections, IgM levels may be significantly lower or undetectable. After 10-12 days, a lifetime specific IgG is produced. Routinely, the laboratory diagnosis of DENV infections can be performed by viral isolation and/or detection of viral nucleic acid, serological assays for the detection of specific antibodies (IgM/IgG), antigen (NS1) and the detection of viral antigens in tissues, which are suitable during certain phases of the disease. For serological diagnosis, serum, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples may be investigated. If the test is carried out a few days after collection, the specimens can be stored at 4 °C, since the immunoglobulins are stable in serum or plasma. If the storage period is extended, the material must be kept at -20 °C or -70 °C.

Mosquito bites were characterized by an edema that retained virus at the inoculation site and an inflammatory influx of neutrophils that coordinated a localized innate immune program that inadvertently facilitated virus infection by encouraging the entry and infection of virus-permissive myeloid cells. Neutrophil depletion and therapeutic blockade of inflammasome activity suppressed inflammation and abrogated the ability of the bite to promote infection.

Following differentiation, MBCs remain in peripheral circulation after recovery and are poised to secrete antigen-specific antibodies if and when they are re-exposed to their cognate antigen. Consequently, MBCs form the founder population and provide one of the first lines of pathogen-specific defense against reinfection. The role MBCs play is complicated for viruses that are heterologous, such as dengue virus (DENV), which exist as antigenically different serotypes. On second infection with a different serotype, MBCs from initial dengue infection rapidly proliferate and secrete antibodies: many of these MBC derived antibodies will be cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing, while some antibodies may recognize epitopes conserved across serotypes and have the capacity to broadly neutralize 2 or more serotypes. It is also possible that a new population of MBCs and antibodies specific for the second virus serotype need to arise for long-term broader immunity to develop. Methods to interrogate and track memory B cell responses are important for evaluating both natural immunity and vaccine response. However, the low abundance of MBCs for any specific pathogen makes it challenging to interrogate frequency, specificity, and breadth for the pathogen of interest. This review discusses current approaches that have been used to interrogate the memory B cell immune response against viral pathogens in general and DENV specifically.

Recent evidence has provided further information of neutralizing versus enhancing monoclonal antibodies and their target epitopes on the dengue virion, which has major implications for vaccine design. The role of T-cell immunopathology has also been advanced with recent evidence of cross-reactive high pro-inflammatory cytokine producing T cells predominating in severe dengue.

We show that variation in model parameters governing the immune response is sufficient to create the observed variation in virus dynamics between individuals. Estimating model parameter values, we find parameter differences between primary and secondary cases consistent with the theory of antibody-dependent enhancement (namely enhanced rates of viral entry to target cells in secondary cases). Finally, we use our model to examine the potential impact of an antiviral drug on the within-host dynamics of dengue.

Of note, arboviral infections represented approximately 30% of all emerging vector-borne diseases in the last decade. Therapeutic strategies against infectious viral diseases include the use of different classes of molecules that act directly on the pathogen and/or act by optimizing the host immune response. Drugs targeting the virus usually provide amelioration of symptoms by suppressing and controlling the infection. However, it is limited by the short-window of effectiveness, ineffectiveness against latent viruses, development of drug-resistant mutants and toxic side effects. Disease may also be a consequence of an excessive, uncontrolled or misplaced inflammatory response, treatments that interfere in host immune response are interesting options and can be used isolated or in combination with virus-targeted therapies.

With climate change and the convenience of travel, dengue is spreading beyond its usual tropical and subtropical boundaries. Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes diseases ranging widely in severity, from self-limited dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage are the major clinical manifestations associated with severe DENV infection, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Besides the direct effects of the virus, immunopathogenesis is also involved in the development of dengue disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement increases the efficiency of virus infection and may suppress type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses. Aberrant activation of T cells and overproduction of soluble factors cause an increase in vascular permeability. DENV-induced autoantibodies against endothelial cells, platelets, and coagulatory molecules lead to their abnormal activation or dysfunction. Molecular mimicry between DENV proteins and host proteins may explain the cross-reactivity of DENV-induced autoantibodies.

Murine microglia (BV2) were infected in-vitro with Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (1-4) and their immune response was evaluated. Gene expressions of TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL1-β constituted the pro-inflammatory response, levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 represented the regulatory mechanism and changes in the levels of Occludin, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 encompassed the break-down of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Cytokine response was studied using RT-PCR, with relative fold change assessed using ΔΔCt method. We observed that DENV1 increased vascular permeability and trans-membrane transport, while DENV2 resulted in oxidative stress. DENV3 infection presented with impaired immune response and DENV4 manifested a chaotropic response of the BBB protein genes. However, no serotype was able to breakdown the BBB, thus validating the low prevalence of encephalitis in dengue. Our study is the first reported evidence of the microglial immune response resisting the entry of DENV into the CNS. It also supports the theory that primary Dengue infection results in the acute inflammation of the microglia, and the host immune response plays a critical role in development of encephalitis."""

We evaluated chemokine receptors expression and single/multifunctional frequencies of IFNγ, TNF, and IL2-producing T cells during these infections. Even without antigenic stimulation, it was possible to detect chemokine receptors and IFNγ, TNF, and IL2-producing T cells from all individuals by flow cytometry.

In this work, we formulate a within-host model which mechanistically recapitulates characteristics of antibody dependent enhancement in Dengue infection. The within-host scale is then linked to epidemiological spread by a vector-host partial differential equation model structured by host antibody level. The coupling allows for dynamic population-wide antibody levels to be tracked through primary and secondary infections by distinct Dengue strains, along with waning of cross-protective immunity after primary infection. Analysis of both the within-host and between-host systems are conducted. Stability results in the epidemic model are formulated via basic and invasion reproduction numbers as a function of immunological variables.

Our results provide a detailed description of innate immune programs active in peripheral blood during acute HCV infection, which include prominent type I interferon and inflammatory signatures. Innate immune gene expression rapidly returns to pre-infection levels upon viral clearance. Comparative analyses using peripheral blood gene expression profiles from other viral and vaccine studies demonstrate similarities in the immune responses to acute HCV and flaviviruses. Of note, both acute dengue virus (DENV) infection and acute HCV infection elicit similar innate antiviral signatures. However, while transient in DENV infection, this signature was sustained for many weeks in the response to HCV.

While this mutant DENV is highly attenuated and immunogenic, the mechanism of this attenuation has not been elucidated. In this study, we find that replication of this mutant DENV is attenuated very early during infection. This early attenuation is not dependent on a functional type I interferon response and coincides with early activation of the innate immune response.

Given the genetic austerity of the virus, they depend on cellular factors and organelles to complete its replication. One of the cellular components required for flavivirus infection is cholesterol. Cholesterol is an abundant lipid in biomembranes of eukaryotes cells and is necessary to maintain the cellular homeostasis. Recently, it has been reported, that cholesterol is fundamental during flavivirus infection in both mammal and insect vector models. During infection with DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and WNV the modulation of levels of host-cholesterol facilitates viral entry, replicative complexes formation, assembly, egress, and control of the interferon type I response. This modulation involves changes in cholesterol uptake with the concomitant regulation of cholesterol receptors as well as changes in cholesterol synthesis related to important modifications in cellular metabolism pathways. In view of the flavivirus dependence of cholesterol and the lack of an effective anti-flaviviral treatment, this cellular lipid has been proposed as a therapeutic target to treat infection using FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drugs.

The potential effects on DENV infection of previous exposure to Ae. aegypti salivary proteins have not been investigated. We collected Ae. aegypti saliva, concentrated the proteins and fractionated them by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). By the use of immunoblots, we analysed reactivity with the mosquito salivary proteins (MSP) of sera from 96 Thai children diagnosed with secondary DENV infections leading either to DF or DHF, or with no DENV infection, and found that different proportions of each patient group had serum antibodies reactive to specific Ae. aegypti salivary proteins.

The dengue virus (DENV) comprises four serotypes (DENV1-4). Usually, the primary infection is asymptomatic or causes mild dengue fever (DF), while secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk of severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). Complement system activation induces inflammation and tissue injury, contributing to disease pathogenesis. However, in asymptomatic or primary infections, protective immunity largely results from the complement system's lectin pathway (LP), which is activated through foreign glycan recognition. Differences in N-glycans displayed on the DENV envelope membrane influence the lectin pattern recognition receptor (PRR) binding efficiency. The important PRR, mannan binding lectin (MBL), mediates DENV neutralization through (1) a complement activation-independent mechanism via direct MBL glycan recognition, thereby inhibiting DENV attachment to host target cells, or (2) a complement activation-dependent mechanism following the attachment of complement opsonins C3b and C4b to virion surfaces. The serum concentrations of lectin PRRs and their polymorphisms influence these LP activities. Conversely, to escape the LP attack and enhance the infectivity, DENV utilizes the secreted form of nonstructural protein 1 (sNS1) to counteract the MBL effects, thereby increasing viral survival and dissemination."""

With an annual global burden of approximately 390 million infections occurring in the tropics and subtropics worldwide, an effective vaccine to combat dengue is urgently needed. Historically, a major impediment to dengue research has been development of a suitable small animal infection model that mimics the features of human illness in the absence of neurologic disease that was the hallmark of earlier mouse models. Recent advances in immunocompromised murine infection models have resulted in development of lethal DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 models in AG129 mice that are deficient in both the interferon-α/β receptor (IFN-α/β R) and the interferon-γ receptor (IFN-γR). These models mimic many hallmark features of dengue disease in humans, such as viremia, thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and cytokine storm. Importantly AG129 mice develop lethal, acute, disseminated infection with systemic viral loads, which is characteristic of typical dengue illness. Infected AG129 mice generate an antibody response to DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) models have been established by both passive and maternal transfer of DENV-immune sera. Several steps have been taken to refine DENV mouse models. Viruses generated by peripheral in vivo passages incur substitutions that provide a virulent phenotype using smaller inocula. Because IFN signaling has a major role in immunity to DENV, mice that generate a cellular immune response are desired, but striking the balance between susceptibility to DENV and intact immunity is complicated. Great strides have been made using single-deficient IFN-α/βR mice for DENV-2 infection, and conditional knockdowns may offer additional approaches to provide a panoramic view that includes viral virulence and host immunity. Ultimately, the DENV AG129 mouse models result in reproducible lethality and offer multiple disease parameters to evaluate protection by candidate vaccines."""

Such heterogeneity in DENV infection in cells could be attributed to a range of factors, including host cell immune response, anti-viral cellular proteins, and virus mediated cellular autophagy. This review delineates an important feature of every cell, the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is attributed to the accumulation of several viral and unfolded/misfolded proteins, such as in DENV infection. UPR is a normal process to counteract endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that leads to cell autophagy; though the phenomenon is markedly upregulated during DENV infection. This could be attributed to the uncontrolled activation of the key UPR signaling pathways: inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1 (IRE1), protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), which promote cell autophagy under normal and diseased conditions through the downstream regulation of apoptosis promoting factors such as X-box binding protein (XBP1), GADD34, and ATF-6. Because DENV can modulate these signaling cascades, by promoting dysregulated cell autophagy, the ER stress mediated UPR pathways and the inherent agents could play an important role in delineating the severity of dengue infection with a potential for developing DENV targeted therapeutics."""

We hypothesised that inadequate AnxA1 engagement underlies the cytokine storm and vascular pathologies associated with dengue disease. Levels of AnxA1 were examined in the plasma of dengue patients and infected mice. Immunocompetent, interferon (alpha and beta) receptor one knockout (KO), AnxA1 KO, and formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) KO mice were infected withdengue virus(DENV) and treated with the AnxA1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26for analysis.

Yet, despite the seriousness of this disease, vaccine, and antiviral drugs that could be employed in dengue treatment remain elusive. The desire to establish the factors determining the disease severity and the growing need for efficient drugs has prompted extensive research interest in within-host viral dynamics. However, very few mathematical models of within-host dengue dynamics pertaining to secondary dengue infection with another serotype are presently available. To address this gap in the pertinent literature, in this work, a secondary dengue infection model with T-cell mediated adaptive immunity and antibody-dependent enhancement was developed by considering the memory cell and heterogeneous antibody as the main factor. In particular, the explicit role of cytokines is considered for both virus and infected cell clearance, along with both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms for antibody-dependent enhancement. In case of secondary dengue infection, both the virus and homogeneous antibody production are enhanced due to the influence of memory cells remaining from the previous (primary) dengue infection. Owing to the high model sensitivity, it was possible to establish that, among antibody-dependent enhancement mechanisms, the increased virus replication inside the infected cell, which increases the overall virus burst size, exerts the maximum effect on disease severity during secondary infection. Moreover, the role of initial memory cell concentrations and half-saturation constant in the secretion of memory cell in the disease severity was studied. The obtained results concur with the clinical observations and may be helpful in further research on antibody-dependent enhancements aimed at producing schemes relevant for the dengue vaccine design and development."""

Consequently, the modulation of immune response has emerged as an important therapeutic target for the control of DENV infection. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the immune response in DENV infection, although the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by miRNAs offers an opportunity to gain insight into the immunomodulation mediated by vitamin D.Objective:Previously, it has been observed that a high dose of vitamin D (4000 IU) decreased DENV-2 infection and inflammatory response in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Here, we examine whether high or low doses of vitamin D supplements exert differential effect on miRNA expression in DENV-infected macrophages.Methods:We analyzed miRNA expression profiles in MDMs isolated from healthy individuals who were given either 1000 or 4000 IU/day of vitamin D for 10 days. MDMs before or after vitamin D supplementation were challenged with DENV-2, and miRNAs profiles were analyzed by qPCR arrays.Results:DENV-2 infected MDMs supplemented with 4000 IU, showed up-regulation of miR-374a-5p, miR-363-3p, miR-101-3p, miR-9-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-200a-3p, and the family of miRNAs miR-21-5p, and miR-590-p. The miRNA profile and predicted target mRNAs suggested regulatory pathways in MDMs obtained from healthy donors who received higher doses of vitamin D.

The transcript of the SAT1 gene, of well-known antiviral action, displayed higher inclusion of exon 4 in infected cells, leading to an mRNA isoform that is degraded by non-sense mediated decay. SAT1 is a spermidine/spermine acetyl-transferase enzyme that decreases the reservoir of cellular polyamines, limiting viral replication. Delving into the molecular mechanism underlying SAT1 pre-mRNA splicing changes upon viral infection, we observed lower protein levels of RBM10, a splicing factor responsible for SAT1 exon 4 skipping. We found that the dengue polymerase NS5 interacts with RBM10 and its sole expression triggers RBM10 proteasome-mediated degradation. RBM10 over-expression in infected cells prevents SAT1 splicing changes and limits viral replication, while its knock-down enhances the splicing switch and also benefits viral replication, revealing an anti-viral role for RBM10. Consistently, RBM10 depletion attenuates expression of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In particular, we found that RBM10 interacts with viral RNA and RIG-I, and even promotes the ubiquitination of the latter, a crucial step for its activation.

DENV infection causes a wide variety of clinical manifestations that range from asymptomatic to dengue fever, and in some cases may evolve to the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The exact reasons why some patients do not have symptoms while others develop the severe forms of disease are still elusive, but gathered evidence showed correlation between a secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype and the occurrence of severe symptoms. Despite several advances, the mechanisms of DENV infection are still not completely elucidated, and efforts have been made to understand the development of immunity and/or pathology to DENV. When a mosquito transmits DENV, the virus is initially deposited in the skin, where mononuclear phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), become infected. DCs play a critical role in the induction of immune responses, as they are able to rapidly detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns, endocytose and process antigens, and efficiently activate naïve-T and B cells. Recent findings have shown that DCs serve as DENV targets, but they are also important mediators of immunity against the virus. In this review, we will briefly discuss DENV infection pathogenesis, and introduce DCs as central players in the induction of anti-DENV immune responses.

Here, we investigated the impact of co-infection on immune responses and pathogenesis in a new mouse model. Co-infection of otherwise sublethal doses of a Nicaraguan clinical H1N1 isolate and two days later with a virulent DENV2 strain increased systemic DENV titers and caused 90% lethality.

The clinical manifestations of infection with one of the four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) range from no symptoms to hemorrhagic fever and shock (""""severe dengue""""), which is fatal in ~25,000 patients annually. Many factors contribute to the development of severe dengue, including the DENV serotype and host expression of certain HLA alleles; however, it now seems clear that pre-existing immunity to DENV-and possibly other flaviviruses-is a major precipitating factor. While primary infection with one DENV serotype elicits strong cellular and humoral immune responses that likely confer long-lived protection against the same serotype, subsequent infection with a different serotype carries an increased risk of developing severe dengue. Thus, primary DENV infection elicits cross-reactive immunity that may be protective or pathogenic, depending on the context of the subsequent infection. Many flaviviruses share high sequence homology, raising the possibility that cross-reactive immunity to one virus may contribute to protection against or pathogenesis of a second virus in a similar manner.

Dengue viruses cause dengue fever and severe life-threatening illnesses as well as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. All four serotypes of dengue virus can cause dengue diseases, but the manifestations are nearly different depending on type of the virus in consequent infections. Infection by any serotype creates life-long immunity against the corresponding serotype and temporary immunity to the others. This transient immunity declines after a while (6 months to 2 years) and is not protective against other serotypes, even may enhance the severity of a secondary heterotypic infection with a different serotype through a phenomenon known as antibody-depended enhancement (ADE). Although, it can be one of the possible explanations for more severe dengue diseases in individuals infected with a different serotype after primary infection. The envelope protein (E protein) of dengue virus is responsible for a wide range of biological activities, including binding to host cell receptors and fusion to and entry into host cells. The E protein, and especially its domain III (EDIII), stimulates host immunity responses by inducing protective and neutralizing antibodies.

Increased risk of severe disease occurs during secondary infection with a virus serotype distinct from that of prior dengue infection. This occurs by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, wherein sub-neutralizing antibodies against the virus particles opsonize dengue virus entry via formation of immune complexes that interact with fragment crystallizable gamma receptors (FcγR) on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The ADE phenomenon has two components: Extrinsic and Intrinsic ADE. While extrinsic ADE contributes to enhanced virus entry, intrinsic ADE results in heightened virus production by inhibition of type1 interferon and activation of interleukin-10 biosynthesis, thereby favoring a Th2 type immune response. Intrinsic ADE has greater contribution in enhancing Dengue replication as compared to extrinsic ADE.

The antiviral actions start with the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from the virus, then ultimately turning on particular transcription factors to generate antiviral interferons (IFNs) or proinflammatory cytokines via fine-tuned signaling cascades. With dengue virus (DENV) infection, its viral RNA is recognized by the host RNA sensors, mainly retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and toll-like receptors. DENV infection also activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING)-mediated DNA-sensing pathway despite the absence of a DNA stage in the DENV lifecycle. In the last decade, DENV has been considered a weak IFN-inducing pathogen with the evidence that DENV has evolved multiple strategies antagonizing the host IFN system. DENV passively escapes from innate immunity surveillance and also actively subverts the innate immune system at multiple steps. DENV targets both RNA-triggered RLR-mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (RLR-MAVS) and DNA-triggered cGAS-STING signaling to reduce IFN production in infected cells. It also blocks IFN action by inhibiting IFN regulatory factor- and signal transducer and activator of transcription-mediated signaling.

During virus replication, RNA synthesis is mediated by a dynamic and membrane-bound multi-protein assembly, named the replication complex (RC). The RC is composed of both viral and host-cell proteins that assemble within vesicles composed of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, near the nucleus. At the heart of the flavivirus RC lies NS4B, a viral integral membrane protein that plays a role in virulence and in down-regulating the innate immune response.

Overall, our results suggest that RACK1 acts as a binding platform at the surface of the 40S ribosomal subunit to recruit Vigilin and SERBP1, which may therefore function as linkers between the viral RNA and the translation machinery to facilitate infection."""

They employ different mechanisms to control interferon signal transduction and effector pathways, and key research generated over the past couple of decades has uncovered new insights into their abilities to actively decrease interferon antiviral activity. Given the lack of antivirals or prophylactic treatments for many flaviviral infections, it is important to fully understand how these viruses affect cellular processes to influence pathogenesis and disease outcome.

Hemorrhage and plasma leakage are two major hallmarks of DHF/DSS. Because the mechanisms causing these pathogenic changes are unclear, there is no effective therapy against DHF/DSS. In this review, we focus on the possible pathogenic effects of a pleiotropic cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), on the pathogenesis of DENV infection. MIF is a critical mediator of the host immune response and inflammation, and there is a correlation between the serum levels of MIF and disease severity in dengue patients. Furthermore, MIF knock-out mice exhibit less severe clinical disease and lethality. However, the role of MIF in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not limited to immune cell recruitment. Recent evidence indicates that DENV infection induced MIF production and may contribute to vascular hyperpermeability and viral replication during DENV infection. The expression of both adhesion and coagulation molecules on MIF-stimulated monocytes and endothelial cells is also increased, which may contribute to inflammatory and anticoagulatory states during DHF/DSS. Therefore, blocking MIF production or its function may provide a solution for the treatment and prevention of DHF/DSS."""

While most of the infected individuals show minimal or no symptoms and recover spontaneously, a small proportion of the patients exhibit severe symptoms characterized by extreme dyspnea and low tissue oxygen levels, with extensive damage to the lungs referred to as acute respiratory distress symptom (ARDS). The consensus is that the hyperinflammatory response of the host is akin to the cytokine storm observed during sepsis and is the major cause of death. Uncertainties remain on the factors that lead to hyperinflammatory response in some but not all individuals. Hyperinflammation is a common feature in different viral infections such as dengue where existing low-titer antibodies to the virus enhances the infection in immune cells through a process called antibody-dependent enhancement or ADE. ADE has been reported following vaccination or secondary infections with other corona, Ebola and dengue virus.

The ubiquitin system can be hijacked by viruses to enhance various steps of the replication cycle and increase pathogenesis. Emerging viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses like Zika and dengue, as well as highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola and Nipah, have the ability to directly use the ubiquitination process to enhance their viral-replication cycle, and evade immune responses.

Like other viruses, DENV relies heavily on the host cellular machinery for productive infection. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen using haploid HAP1 cells to identify host genes important for DENV infection. We identified DPM1 and -3, two subunits of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS) complex, as host dependency factors for DENV and other related flaviviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV). The DPMS complex catalyzes the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM), which serves as mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, and C- or O-mannosylation of proteins in the ER lumen. Mutation in the DXD motif of DPM1, which is essential for its catalytic activity, abolished DPMS-mediated DENV infection. Similarly, genetic ablation of ALG3, a mannosyltransferase that transfers mannose to lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), rendered cells poorly susceptible to DENV. We also established that in cells deficient for DPMS activity, viral RNA amplification is hampered and truncated oligosaccharides are transferred to the viral prM and E glycoproteins, affecting their proper folding. Overall, our study provides new insights into the host-dependent mechanisms of DENV infection and supports current therapeutic approaches using glycosylation inhibitors to treat DENV infection.IMPORTANCEDengue disease, which is caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans and is a major global health concern.

Arboviruses, including dengue and West Nile virus, are injected into vertebrates within mosquito saliva during mosquito feeding. Mosquito saliva contains anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules that facilitate the acquisition of a blood meal. Collectively, studies investigating the effects of mosquito saliva on the vertebrate immune response suggest that at high concentrations salivary proteins are immmunosuppressive, whereas lower concentrations modulate the immune response; specifically, T(H)1 and antiviral cytokines are downregulated, while T(H)2 cytokines are unaffected or amplified. As a consequence, mosquito saliva can impair the antiviral immune response, thus affecting viral infectiousness and host survival. Mounting evidence suggests that this is a mechanism whereby arbovirus pathogenicity is enhanced.

It is activated when there is an imbalance in the protein load and protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a result of an increase in the naïve, unfolded, or misfolded protein content of the cell. Dengue virus (DENV) utilizes the host machinery to synthesize viral proteins and replicates in the cell. During DENV infection, up-regulation of viral proteins increases the protein pool of the cell, resulting in the induction of UPR pathway.

To fulfill this objective, we have used VER-155008 (VER), a known inhibitor of the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), which is the master regulator of the UPR pathway. After VER treatment, cells were infected with DENV, and the induction of the UPR elements and their downstream activation was studied by western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, inhibition of GRP78 via VER treatment led to the decreased expression of DENV envelope protein through the activation of the UPR elements, protein kinase-like ER resident kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and then led to the activation of innate immune factors such as double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), interferon regulated factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β).

By building up from a simple target cell limited model, we show that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the characteristic features of a primary symptomatic dengue infection, while a higher rate of viral infectivity (indicative of antibody-dependent enhancement) and infected cell clearance by T cells are further needed to recover the characteristic features of a secondary dengue infection. We show that these minimal models can reproduce the increased risk of disease associated with secondary heterologous infections that arises as a result of a cytokine storm, and, further, that they are consistent with virological indicators that predict the onset of severe disease, such as the magnitude of peak viraemia, time to peak viral load, and viral clearance rate. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of these virological indicators to predict the onset of severe disease depends on the contribution of T cells in fuelling the cytokine storm."""

Symbiotic associations of the maternally transmitted bacterium Wolbachia occur with a wide range of arthropods. It is, however, absent from the dengue and Zika vector mosquito Aedes aegypti in nature. When Wolbachia is artificially forced to form symbiosis with this new mosquito host, it boosts the basal immune response and enhances the mosquito's resistance to pathogens, including dengue, Zika virus and malaria parasites. The mechanisms involved in establishing a symbiotic relationship between Wolbachia and A. aegypti, and the long-term outcomes of this interaction, are not well understood. Here, we have demonstrated that both the immune deficiency (IMD) and Toll pathways are activated by the Wolbachia strain wAlbB upon its introduction into A. aegypti. Silencing the Toll and IMD pathways via RNA interference reduces the wAlbB load. Notably, wAlbB induces peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LE expression in the carcass of A. aegypti, and its silencing results in a reduction of symbiont load. Using transgenic mosquitoes with stage-specific induction of the IMD and Toll pathways, we have shown that elevated wAlbB infection in these mosquitoes is maintained via maternal transmission. These results indicate that host innate immunity is utilized to establish and promote host-microbial symbiosis. Our results will facilitate a long-term projection of the stability of the Wolbachia-A. aegypti mosquito system that is being developed to control dengue and Zika virus transmission to humans."""

Due to this complexity, the relative contributions of the virus and host factors are best studiedin vivousing animal models. In this review, we describe how the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been used as a powerful model to study host-virus interactions and inflammation by combining robust forward and reverse genetic tools within vivoimaging of transparent embryos and larvae. The innate immune system has an essential role in the initial inflammatory response to viral infection. Focused studies of the innate immune response to viral infection are possible using the zebrafish model as there is a 4-6 week timeframe during development where they have a functional innate immune system dominated by neutrophils and macrophages. During this timeframe, zebrafish lack a functional adaptive immune system, so it is possible to study the innate immune response in isolation. Sequencing of the zebrafish genome has revealed significant genetic conservation with the human genome, and multiple studies have revealed both functional conservation of genes, including those critical to host cell infection and host cell inflammatory response. In addition to studying several fish viruses, zebrafish infection models have been developed for several human viruses, including influenza A, noroviruses, chikungunya, Zika, dengue, herpes simplex virus type 1, Sindbis, and hepatitis C virus. The development of these diverse viral infection models, coupled with the inherent strengths of the zebrafish model, particularly as it relates to our understanding of macrophage and neutrophil biology, offers opportunities for far more intensive studies aimed at understanding conserved host responses to viral infection.

The generally accepted hypothesis explaining the immunopathogenesis of severe dengue is called antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue infection. Here, circulating antibodies bind to the newly infecting virus but do not neutralize infection. Rather, these antibodies increase the infected cell mass and virus production. Additionally, antiviral responses are diminished allowing massive virus particle production early in infection.

There are no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs for treatment of infected patients. However, there is a novel approach to control DENV transmission by the mosquito vectors,Aedes aegyptiandAedes albopictus, using theWolbachiasymbiont. ThewMelPop strain ofWolbachiasuppresses DENV transmission and shortens the mosquito life span. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To clarify this mechanism, either naiveA. albopictus(C6/36) orwMelPop-C6/36 cells were infected with DENV serotype 2 (DENV2). Analysis of host transcript profiles by transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) revealed that the presence ofwMelPop dramatically altered the mosquito host cell transcription in response to DENV2 infection. The viral RNA evolved fromwMelPop-C6/36 cells contained low-frequency mutations (∼25%) within the coding region of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) of E protein. Mutations with >97% frequencies were distributed within other regions of E, the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5POL) domain, and the TMDs of NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B. Moreover, while DENV2-infected naive C6/36 cells showed syncytium formation, DENV2-infectedwMelPop-C6/36 cells did not. TheWolbachia-induced mutant DENV2 can readily infect and replicate in naive C6/36 cells, whereas in mutant DENV2-infected BHK-21 or Vero cells, virus replication was delayed. In LLC-MK2 cells, the mutant failed to produce plaques. Additionally, in BHK-21 cells, many mutations in the viral genome reverted to the wild type (WT) and compensatory mutations in NS3 gene appeared.

These can be vital host responses to protect against acute, chronic, and recurrent viral infections. Consequently, many viruses (including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Nipah virus) have evolved mechanisms for evasion or dysregulation of the complement system to enhance viral infectivity and even exacerbate disease symptoms. The complement system has multifaceted roles in both innate and adaptive immunity, with both intracellular and extracellular functions, that can be relevant to all stages of viral infection.

The conventional'one disease - one pathogen'paradigm has been positively revisited by considering limited yet important evidence of the co-presence of multiple transcriptionally active microbes (TAMs), potential pathogens, in various infectious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The ubiquitous microbiota presence inside humans gives reason to hypothesize that the microbiome, especially TAMs, contributes to disease etiology. Herein, we discuss current evidence and inferences on the co-infecting microbes particularly in the diseases caused by the RNA viruses - Influenza, Dengue, and the SARS-CoV-2. We have highlighted that the specific alterations in the microbial taxonomic abundances (dysbiosis) is functionally connected to the exposure of primary infecting pathogen/s. The microbial presence is intertwined with the differential host immune response modulating differential disease trajectories. The microbiota-host interactions have been shown to modulate the host immune responses to Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection, wherein the active commensal microbes are involved in the generation of virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells following the influenza virus infection. Furthermore, COVID-19 dysbiosis causes an increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, which might be one of the important predisposing factors for severe infection. Through this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of functional microbiomes that can have a significant regulatory impact on predicting disease severity (mild, moderate and severe), as well as clinical outcome (survival and mortality).

Therefore, to study the role of exosomes during flavivirus infections is essential, not only to understand its relevance in virus-host interaction, but also to identify molecular factors that may contribute to the development of new strategies to block these viral infections.

The purpose of our study was to assess the contribution of human keratinocytes as potential host cells to DENV in the activation of immune responses at the anatomical site of mosquito bite. We show that primary keratinocytes support DENV replication with the production of negative-stranded viral RNAs inside the infected cells. In the course of DENV life cycle, we observed the activation of host genes involved in the antiviral immune responses such as intracellular RNA virus sensors Toll-Like Receptor-3, Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene-I, Melanoma Differentiation Associated gene-5 and the RNA-dependent protein kinase R. DENV infection of primary keratinocytes also resulted in up-regulation of the expression of the antiviral Ribonuclease L gene, which subsequently led to enhanced production of IFN-β and IFN-γ. Depending on stages of viral replication, we observed the activation of host genes encoding the antimicrobial proteins β-defensin and RNase 7 in infected keratinocytes.

Here, two field Ae. aegypti populations from distinct ecological environments, one from Recife and the other from Petrolina (Brazil), and a laboratory strain were studied for their ability to replicate a primary isolate of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Virus infectivity and replication were determined in insect tissues collected after viral exposure through reverse-transcription real time PCR (RT-PCR). The expression of a transcript representing these defense mechanisms (Toll, JAK-STAT and RNAi) in the midgut and fat body was studied with RT-PCR to evaluate variations in innate immune mechanisms possibly employed against DENV. Analyses of infection rates indicated that the field populations were more susceptible to DENV-2 infection than the lab strain. There were distinct expression patterns among mosquito populations, in both control and infected insects. Moreover, lower expression of immune molecules in DENV-2-infected insects compared to controls was observed in the two field populations. These results suggest that natural variations in vector competence against DENV may be partly due to differences in mosquito defense mechanisms, and that the down-regulation of immune transcripts after viral infection depends on the insect strain."""

We previously demonstrated that CD8+T cell responses elicited by a dengue live attenuated virus (DLAV) vaccine resemble those observed after natural infection. In this study, we screened peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors vaccinated with a tetravalent DLAV vaccine (TV005) with pools of dengue virus-derived predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II binding peptides. The definition of CD4+T cell responses after live vaccination is important because CD4+T cells are known contributors to host immunity, including cytokine production, help for CD8+T and B cells, and direct cytotoxicity against infected cells. While responses to all antigens were observed, DENV-specific CD4+T cells were focused predominantly on the capsid and nonstructural NS3 and NS5 antigens. Importantly, CD4+T cell responses in vaccinees were similar in magnitude and breadth to those after natural infection, recognized the same antigen hierarchy, and had similar profiles of HLA restriction. We conclude that TV005 vaccination has the capacity to elicit CD4+cell responses closely mirroring those observed in a population associated with natural immunity.IMPORTANCEThe development of effective vaccination strategies against dengue virus infection is of high global public health interest. Here we study the CD4 T cell responses elicited by a tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine and show that they resemble responses seen in humans naturally exposed to dengue virus. This is an important issue, since it is likely that optimal immunity induced by a vaccine requires induction of CD4+responses against the same antigens as those recognized as dominant in natural infection. Detailed knowledge of the T cell response may further contribute to the identification of robust correlates of protection against dengue virus."""
30333266,Early Detection of Plasma Leakage inDengueHemorrhagic Fever.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333266/,Nelwan EJ.,,2018,Acta Med Indones,"""Dengue viral infection remains a major public health problem. As many as 400 million people are infected yearly. Even though the vaccine is available, the use of dengue vaccine is still limited due to some concerns. Among patient infected with dengue viral infection, early recognition of the virus and prompt supportive treatment are important to avoid complication and mortality.The clinical spectrum of dengue viral infection is diverse ranging from undifferentiated fever to dengue shock syndrome characterized by plasma leak and hemoconcentration. No specific antiviral therapy is available. Therefore, anticipation of complication should be performed adequately.The most dangerous complication of dengue infection is shock syndrome. Hypothetically the occurrence of shock is a result of secondary viral infection. The manifestation of increased vascular permeability and low intravascular volume lead to the development of shock. In addition to that, another complex mechanism underlies the occurrence of shock such as endothelial dysfunction that could happened abruptly. No specific method exists to identify this condition as early as possible.During dengue infection, fever can be last between 2 and 7 days. The localized plasma leakage could happen and manifested as a pleural effusion fluid accumulation in abdominal cavity or hemoconcentration. This will only last for 48 hours and will be resolved later spontaneously. Severity of leakage varies among patients and the unanticipated of leakage due to failure to recognize and treat this manifestation related to mortality.Most of the fatal cases of dengue are related to late detection of the illness as shown by massive hemorrhage and severe intravascular volume depletion. The role of dendritic cells is as the initiator of immune response that facilitate virus uptake. On the other hand, the non-neutralize cross reactive antibodies will increase virus uptake and resulted in more viral replication. Some studies showed higher NS1 protein were found in patients with more severe disease. In addition to that antibody to NS1 could bind to the endothelial cells and lead to apoptosis of these cells. Both host and viral factors contribute to the severity of the illness.One of the important factors for dengue viral infection is the capacity of clinicians to identify the risk factors for shock. Studies reported that female, infants, elderly, patients with concomitant diseases are prone to have more severe infection. Virus serotype and genetic susceptibility may also contribute but the evidence is still limited. So, those are not sensitive enough be used in clinical setting.Besides those, after the diagnosis of with dengue infection based on WHO criteria and confirmation by serology detection or viral material in the blood, no specific sign and symptoms are available to determine any potential severity. There were studies performed to monitor the plasma leakage using mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) instead of hematocrit values. Rapid intervention can be administered by monitoring MAP to avoid deleterious consequences.The classification of WHO 1997 or 2009 were not able to detect the plasma leakage earlier. Nainggolan et al presented the resulted of their observation among early dengue infection which was the occurrence of gallbladder wall thickening as a manifestation of plasma leakage. Ultrasonographic measurement is valuable and applicable to detect plasma leakage in earlier phase with positive likelihood ratio 2.14 (95% CI 1.12 - 4.12).

Despite intensive research, the mechanisms and important cellular players that contribute to dengue disease are unclear. Mast cells are tissue-resident innate immune cells that play a sentinel cell role in host protection against infectious agents via pathogen-recognition receptors by producing potent mediators that modulate inflammation, cell recruitment and normal vascular homeostasis. Most importantly, mast cells are susceptible to antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection and respond with selective cytokine and chemokine responses. In order to obtain a global view of dengue virus-induced gene regulation in mast cells, primary human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) and the KU812 and HMC-1 mast cell lines were infected with dengue virus in the presence of dengue-immune sera and their responses were evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels. Mast cells responded to antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection or polyinosiniċpolycytidylic acid treatment with the production of type I interferons and the rapid and potent production of chemokines including CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL10. Multiple interferon-stimulated genes were also upregulated as well as mRNA and protein for the RNA sensors PKR, RIG-I and MDA5. Dengue virus-induced chemokine production by KU812 cells was significantly modulated by siRNA knockdown of RIG-I and PKR, in a negative and positive manner, respectively. Pretreatment of fresh KU812 cells with supernatants from dengue virus-infected mast cells provided protection from subsequent infection with dengue virus in a type I interferon-dependent manner. These findings support a role for tissue-resident mast cells in the early detection of antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection via RNA sensors, the protection of neighbouring cells through interferon production and the potential recruitment of leukocytes via chemokine production."""

We now report that rodent, monkey, and human MCs are able to detect dengue virus (DENV), a lymphotropic, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that results in MC activation and degranulation. We observe that the response of MCs to DENV also involves the activation of antiviral intracellular host response pathways, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), and the de novo transcription of cytokines, including TNF-α and IFN-α, and chemokines, such as CCL5, CXCL12, and CX3CL1. This multifaceted response of MCs to DENV is consequential to the containment of DENV in vivo because, after s.c. infection, MC-deficient mice show increased viral burden within draining lymph nodes, which are known to be targeted organs during DENV spread, compared with MC-sufficient mice. This containment of DENV is linked to the MC-driven recruitment of natural killer and natural killer T cells into the infected skin.

Dengue virus (DENV) can inhibit both type I IFN production and signaling in susceptible human cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV functions as an antagonist of type I IFN production, and its proteolytic activity is necessary for this function. DENV also encodes proteins that antagonize type I IFN signaling, including NS2A, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 by targeting different components of this signaling pathway, such as STATs. Importantly, the ability of the NS5 protein to bind and degrade STAT2 contributes to the limited host tropism of DENV to humans and non-human primates.

Dysregulated, inappropriate and excessive immune responses are unanimously blamed in fatal leptospirosis. The inherent abilities of the pathogen and inabilities of the host were debated targeting the severity of the disease. Hemorrhagic manifestation through various mechanisms leading to a fatal end is observed when this disease is unattended. The similar vascular destructions and hemorrhage manifestations are noted in infections with different microbes in endemic areas. The simultaneous infection in a host with more than one pathogen or parasite is referred as the coinfection. Notably, common endemic infections such as leptospirosis, dengue, chikungunya, and malaria, harbor favorable environments to flourish in similar climates, which is aggregated with stagnated water and aggravated with the poor personal and environmental hygiene of the inhabitants. These factors aid the spread of pathogens and parasites to humans and potential vectors, eventually leading to outbreaks of public health relevance. Malaria, dengue and chikungunya need mosquitoes as vectors, in contrast with leptospirosis, which directly invades human, although the environmental bacterial load is maintained through other mammals, such as rodents. The more complicating issue is that infections by different pathogens exhibiting similar symptoms but require different treatment management. The current review explores different pathogens expressing specific surface proteins and their ability to bind with array of host proteins with or without immune response to enter into the host tissues and their ability to evade the host immune responses to invade and their affinity to certain tissues leading to the common squeal of hemorrhage. Furthermore, at the host level, the increased susceptibility and inability of the host to arrest the pathogens' and parasites' spread in different tissues, various cytokines accumulated to eradicate the microorganisms and their cellular interactions, the antibody dependent defense and the susceptibility of individual organs bringing the manifestation of the diseases were explored. Lastly, we provided a discussion on the immune trail path of pathogenesis from entry to exit to narrate the similarities and dissimilarities among various hemorrhagic fevers mentioned above, in order to outline future possibilities of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of coinfections, with special reference to endemic areas."""

The key adaptor protein in type I interferon pathway, human mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA) but not the murine homologue MPYS, was cleaved in cells infected with DEN-1 or DEN-2 and with expression of the enzymatically active protease NS2B3. The cleavage site of MITA was mapped to LRR↓(96)G and the function of MITA was suppressed by dengue protease. DEN replication was reduced with overexpression of MPYS but not with MITA, while DEN replication was enhanced by MPYS knockdown, indicating an antiviral role of MITA/MPYS against DEN infection. The involvement of MITA in DEN-triggered innate immune response was evidenced by reduction of IRF3 activation and IFN induction in cells with MITA knockdown upon DEN-2 infection. NS2B3 physically interacted with MITA, and the interaction and cleavage of MITA could be further enhanced by poly(dA:dT) stimulation.

Currently, disease control mainly relies on vector targeted intervention strategies. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the innate immune response of mosquitoes against pathogens. In the present study, the expression profiles of immunity-related genes in the midgut responding to DENV infection by feeding were analyzed by transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR. The level of Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) increased seven days post-infection (d.p.i.), which could be induced by the Toll immune pathway. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) genes, including antioxidant genes, such as HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C were induced at one d.p.i. and peaked again at ten d.p.i. in the midgut. Interestingly, down-regulation of the antioxidant gene HPX8C by RNA interference led to reduction in the virus titer in the mosquito, probably due to the elevated levels of ROS. Application of a ROS inhibitor and scavenger molecules further established the role of oxygen free radicals in the modulation of the immune response to DENV infection.

However, it has been demonstrated that RNA-helicase-mediated innate immunity plays an essential role in defending the host from infection. In our efforts to identify plant-derived antivirals that selectively enhance ISG- and RNA-helicase-mediated antiviral immune responses, we identified a plant, rhodiola, that significantly promoted ISG, RIG-I and MDA 5 gene expression and an antiviral immune response against dengue virus (DENV) infection.

Although neuroinvasive disease has been well described for some viral infections such as Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), others such as dengue virus (DENV) have recently displayed an emerging pattern of neuroinvasive disease, distinct from the previously observed, systemically-induced encephalomyelopathy. In this setting, the immune response is a crucial component of host defence, in preventing viral dissemination and invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). However, subversion of the anti-viral activities of macrophages by flaviviruses can facilitate viral replication and spread, enhancing the intensity of immune responses, leading to severe immune-mediated disease which may be further exacerbated during the subsequent infection with some flaviviruses. Furthermore, in the CNS myeloid cells may be responsible for inducing specific inflammatory changes, which can lead to significant pathological damage during encephalitis. The interaction of virus and cells of the myeloid lineage is complex, and this interaction is likely responsible at least in part, for crucial differences between viral clearance and pathology.

A thorough understanding of the genetic and cellular determinants of pathogen-blocking will significantly enhance the ability of vector control programs to deploy and maintain effectiveWolbachia-mediated control measures."""

DENV infections result in a wide spectrum of clinical disease including dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), a viral haemorrhagic disease characterised by bleeding and plasma leakage. The characteristic feature of DHF is the transient period of plasma leakage and a haemorrhagic tendency. DHF occurs mostly during a secondary DENV infection. Serotype cross-reactive antibodies and mediators from serotype cross-reactive Dengue-specific T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis. A complex interaction between virus, host immune response and endothelial cells likely impacts the barrier integrity and functions of endothelial cells leading to plasma leakage. Recently the role of angiogenic factors and the role of dengue virus on endothelial cell transcription and functions have been studied. Insights into the mechanisms that confer protection or cause disease are critical in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for this important disease."""

Although bacteria, fungi and parasites can be causative agents, the majority of zoonotic infections are caused by viral pathogens. During the past 20 years many factors have converged to cause a dramatic resurgence or emergence of zoonotic diseases. Some of these factors include demographics, social changes, urban sprawl, changes in agricultural practices and global climate changes. In the period between 2014-2017 zoonotic viruses including ebola virus (EBOV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and zika virus (ZIKV), caused prominent outbreaks resulting in significant public health and economic burdens, especially in developing areas where these diseases are most prevalent. When a viral pathogen invades a new human host, it is the innate immune system that serves as the first line of defence. Myeloid cells are especially important to help fight viral infections, including those of zoonotic origins. However, viruses such as EBOV, CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV have evolved mechanisms that allow circumvention of the host's innate immune response, avoiding eradication and leading to severe clinical disease. Herein, the importance of myeloid cells in host defence is discussed and the mechanisms by which these viruses exploit myeloid cells are highlighted. The insights provided in this review will be invaluable for future studies looking to identify potential therapeutic targets towards the treatment of these emerging diseases."""

Since the 1960s, numerous reports have identified a second heterologous dengue virus (DENV) infection as a principal risk factor for severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, DHF/DSS). Modifiers of dengue disease response include the specific sequence of two DENV infections, the interval between infections, and contributions from the human host, such as age, ethnicity, chronic illnesses and genetic background. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus infection has been proposed as the early mechanism underlying DHF/DSS. Dengue cross-reactive antibodies raised following a first dengue infection combine with a second infecting virus to form infectious immune complexes that enter Fc-receptor-bearing cells. This results in an increased number of infected cells and increased viral output per cell. At the late illness stage, high levels of cytokines, possibly the result of T cell elimination of infected cells, result in vascular permeability, leading to shock and death. This review is focused on the etiological role of secondary infections (SI) and mechanisms of ADE."""

Following resolution of symptomatic dengue, this patient remained positive for DENV3 RNA in the blood for 4 months and viruric up to 9 months post-infection despite demonstrable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies throughout this period. Full resolution of DENV infection instead coincided with recovery of CD8+ T cell counts during reversal from lymphopenia.

These positive-strand viral genomes contain structured 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that interact with various host RNA binding proteins (RBPs). These RBPs are functionally important in viral replication, pathogenesis, and defense against host immune mechanisms. Here, we combined RNA chromatography and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins interacting with DENV1-4 3' UTRs. As expected, RBPs displayed distinct binding specificity. Among them, we focused on quaking (QKI) because of its preference for the DENV4 3' UTR (DENV-4/SG/06K2270DK1/2005). RNA immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that QKI interacted with DENV4 genomes in infected cells. Moreover, QKI depletion enhanced infectious particle production of DENV4. On the contrary, QKI did not interact with DENV2 3' UTR, and DENV2 replication was not affected consistently by QKI depletion. Next, we mapped the QKI interaction site and identified a QKI response element (QRE) in DENV4 3' UTR. Interestingly, removal of QRE from DENV4 3' UTR abolished this interaction and increased DENV4 viral particle production. Introduction of the QRE to DENV2 3' UTR led to QKI binding and reduced DENV2 infectious particle production. Finally, reporter assays suggest that QKI reduced translation efficiency of viral RNA.

Aedes spp. and Culex spp. are primarily responsible for the transmission of the most medically important mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Despite the burden of these pathogens on human populations, the interactions between viruses and their mosquito hosts remain enigmatic. Viruses enter the midgut of a mosquito following the mosquito's ingestion of a viremic blood meal. During infection, virus recognition by the mosquito host triggers their antiviral defense mechanism. Of these host defenses, activation of the RNAi pathway is the main antiviral mechanism, leading to the degradation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication and promoting viral clearance. However, whilst antiviral host defense mechanisms limit viral replication, the mosquito immune system is unable to effectively clear the virus. As such, these viruses can establish persistent infection with little or no fitness cost to the mosquito vector, ensuring life-long transmission to humans. Understanding of the mosquito innate immune response enables the discovery of novel antivectorial strategies to block human transmission. This review provides an updated and concise summary of recent studies on mosquito antiviral immune responses, which is a key determinant for successful virus transmission.

Antibodies target DENV by two pathologic mechanisms: virus neutralization and infection enhancement. In dengue patients, the absence of neutralizing activity in the presence of FcγR implies that infection-enhancing activity hampers the neutralizing activity of antibodies, which could potentially lead to symptomatic presentations and severe clinical outcomes.Methods:A total of 100 pair serum samples from adult healthy volunteers were obtained during the dengue season in Ha Noi in 2015 for evaluation of neutralizing and infection-enhancing activity. Additionally, 20 serum samples from acute secondary DENV infection patients were also used as the patient group in this study. PRNT was performed on BHK cells and FcγR-expressing BHK cell lines for all serum samples.Results:Out of 100 residents, positive neutralizing antibodies (N.A) were found in 44.23 and 76.92% for DENV-1; 38.46 and 75% for DENV-2; 19.23 and 15.38% for DENV-3; and 1.92 and 9.62% for DENV-4 for pre and post-dengue season respectively. The percentage of post-exposure residents having positive responses against single, two, or more than three DENV serotypes were 38.46, 44.23 and 15.38%, respectively. A total of 34 residents were DENV seropositive before the dengue season and these individuals demonstrated further elevation of IgG antibodies after the dengue season. At the end of the season, 18 residents were confirmed to be new asymptomatic DENV infection cases. In both groups, N.A titers determined on BHK cells were higher than that on FcγR-expressing BHK cells. In heterotypic N.A responses, N.A titers to the infecting serotype from the samples obtained from pre-exposure group were significantly higher than those of the patient group. However, fold enhancement to the infecting serotypes from the samples in the pre-exposure group was substantially lower as compared to that of the patient group.Conclusion:Before and after the dengue season, serum samples from healthy volunteers demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies and low or absence of infection-enhancement activity.

ZIKV has emerged in regions endemic for dengue virus (DENV), a closely related mosquito-borne flavivirus. Cross-reactive antibodies confound studies of ZIKV epidemiology and pathogenesis. The immune responses to ZIKV may be different in people, depending on their DENV immune status. Here, we focus on the human B cell and antibody response to ZIKV as a primary flavivirus infection to define the properties of neutralizing and protective antibodies generated in the absence of preexisting immunity to DENV. The plasma antibody and memory B cell response is highly ZIKV type-specific, and ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies mainly target quaternary structure epitopes on the viral envelope. To map viral epitopes targeted by protective antibodies, we isolated 2 type-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from a ZIKV case. Both mAbs were strongly neutralizing in vitro and protective in vivo. The mAbs recognize distinct epitopes centered on domains I and II of the envelope protein. We also demonstrate that the epitopes of these mAbs define antigenic regions commonly targeted by plasma antibodies in individuals from endemic and nonendemic regions who have recovered from ZIKV infections."""

Despite simplicity, the model possesses explanatory and predictive capacity, enabling determination of crucial parameters. The model shows that the “infectives” increase exponentially in an outbreak, provided the number of vectors per human exceeds a threshold, illustrating not only vector eradication but measures which minimize their biting frequency and preventing prolonged survival are effective safeguards.Results:In a population consisting of 75% who are susceptible, the threshold is estimated to be 20 mosquitos per person.Conclusions:The model showed that the endemic equilibrium of the system can occur at any level. As demographic changes escalate mosquito breeding, they infect more and more susceptible people. The consequent increase in virus replication induces new strains broadening the genetic diversity of the virus and helping it to overcome the human immune response. The increasing endemicity of dengue due to this is demonstrated by the model."""

While the parameters contributing to dengue immunopathogenesis remain unclear, the collapse of redox homeostasis and the damage induced by oxidative stress have been correlated with the development of inflammation and progression toward the more severe forms of disease. In the present study, we demonstrate that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) late after DENV infection (>24 hpi) resulted from a disruption in the balance between oxidative stress and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response. The DENV NS2B3 protease complex strategically targeted Nrf2 for degradation in a proteolysis-independent manner; NS2B3 licensed Nrf2 for lysosomal degradation. Impairment of the Nrf2 regulator by the NS2B3 complex inhibited the antioxidant gene network and contributed to the progressive increase in ROS levels, along with increased virus replication and inflammatory or apoptotic gene expression. By 24 hpi, when increased levels of ROS and antiviral proteins were observed, it appeared that the proviral effect of ROS overcame the antiviral effects of the interferon (IFN) response. Overall, these studies demonstrate that DENV infection disrupts the regulatory interplay between DENV-induced stress responses, Nrf2 antioxidant signaling, and the host antiviral immune response, thus exacerbating oxidative stress and inflammation in DENV infection.IMPORTANCEDengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that threatens 2.5 billion people in more than 100 countries annually.

Previous studies have reported the importance of the transcription factor Nrf2 in the control of redox homeostasis and antiviral/inflammatory or death responses to DENV. Importantly, the production of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent stress response have been linked to the development of inflammation and progression toward the more severe forms of the disease.

Upon DENV infection of a host cell, DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can be found intracellularly as a monomer, associated with the cell surface as a dimer, and secreted as a hexamer into the bloodstream. NS1 plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle, particularly in RNA replication and immune evasion of the complement pathway. Over the past several years, key roles for NS1 in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease have emerged, including direct action of the protein on the vascular endothelium and triggering release of vasoactive cytokines from immune cells, both of which result in endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leak. Importantly, the adaptive immune response generates a robust response against NS1, and its potential contribution to dengue vaccines is also discussed."""

The expression level of CNOT2 was up-regulated in DENV-infected cells. Down-regulation of CNOT2 significantly reduced DENV RNA replication and protein synthesis. Mechanism study showed that CNOT2 knockdown enhanced JAK-STAT antiviral signaling during DENV infection. Further analysis revealed that CNOT2 negatively modulated IFN-Independent Non-Canonical JAK/STAT pathway by accelerating the mRNA decay of JAK1 and STAT1 via its interaction with CNOT6/6L and CNOT7/8 deadenylases.

Constant haematological abnormalities occurring in DHF and frequently include bone marrow suppression, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. An enhanced immune response of the host to a secondary DV infection is a feature of DHF and leads to many consequences. These are immune complex formation, complement activation, increased histamine release and a massive release of many cytokines into the circulation, leading to shock, vasculopathy, thrombopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The mechanisms underlying the bleeding in DHF are multiple. These are vasculopathy, thrombopathy and DIC. Thrombopathy consists of thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction.

We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses.Methods and findings:we studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort. We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 3×10(-5) and 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020, respectively).

We determined that DENV NS4A interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which was previously found to activate NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thus inducing type I IFN in the mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). We further demonstrated that NS4A is associated with the N-terminal CARD-like (CL) domain and the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain of MAVS. This association prevented the binding of MAVS to RIG-I, resulting in the repression of RIG-I-induced IRF3 activation and, consequently, the abrogation of IFN production.

In order to study the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) with the Aedes aegypti immune response, we have characterized the DENV infection-responsive transcriptome of the immune-competent A. aegypti cell line Aag2. As in mosquitoes, DENV infection transcriptionally activated the cell line Toll pathway and a variety of cellular physiological systems. Most notably, however, DENV infection down-regulated the expression levels of numerous immune signaling molecules and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Functional assays showed that transcriptional induction of AMPs from the Toll and IMD pathways in response to bacterial challenge is impaired in DENV-infected cells. In addition, Escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria species, grew better when co-cultured with DENV-infected cells than with uninfected cells, suggesting a decreased production of AMPs from the IMD pathway in virus-infected cells. Pre-stimulation of the cell line with gram-positive bacteria prior to DENV infection had no effect on DENV titers, while pre-stimulation with gram-negative bacteria resulted in an increase in DENV titers.

Targeted species can vary from amphibians, birds to various mammals, dependent on the virus. For many mosquito-borne flaviviruses the spectrum of targeted species is incompletely understood, in particular with respect to their contribution to the maintenance of virus in certain geographical regions. Furthermore, little is known about virus and host factors contributing to species tropism.

MoDC were selected based on their presence in the skin and their role as an early target cell for several Flaviviruses and their role as immune sentinels. While differences in viral infectivity and replication were minor when comparing porcine with human MoDC for some of the tested Flaviviruses, a particularly strong replication in human MoDC was found with USUV, while JEV appeared to have a stronger tropism for porcine MoDC. With respect to innate immune responses we found high induction of TNF and IFN-β in both human and porcine MoDC after infection with JEV, WNV, and USUV, but not with DENV, ZIKV, and Wesselsbron virus. Spondweni virus induced these cytokine responses only in porcine MoDC. Overall, innate immune responses correlated with early infectivity and cytokine production. In conclusion, we demonstrate Flavivirus-dependent differences in the interaction with MoDC. These may play a role in pathogenesis but appear to only partially reflect the expected species tropism."""

Low platelet count is one of the clinical manifestations of dengue virus (DENV) infection. In MKs, the effect of innate receptors during DENV-infection is not well studied. Here we used MEG-01 cells to investigate DENV serotype 2 induced innate receptors in these cells. DENV RNA was estimated by qRT-PCR in the culture supernatant. The expression of innate receptors was determined by western blot and qPCR. DENV infection led to increased expression of RIG-I at 24 hrs post-infection (hpi) and MDA-5 at 48 and 72 hpi (p<0.05). However, no change in the expression of TLR3 at protein level was observed. Activation of MDA-5 resulted in increased expression of IFN-β and ISG-15 in DENV infected MEG-01 cells, which was further confirmed by MDA-5 siRNA treatment. Apart from inducing innate receptors, DENV significantly decreases the expression of CD61, an activation marker of megakaryocyteson MEG-01 cells as observed by flow cytometry analysis (p<0.01). Results from this study confirm that DENV infection activates the type-I interferon in megakaryocytes and may play a significant role in maturation and development."""

The goal of the study was to evaluate the correlation between alterations in IL-2 and IL-18 levels with alterations in hepatic enzymes in dengue-infected patients. Accordingly, a total of 91 NS1/IgM confirmed DENV infected patients were selected for the IL-2 and IL-18 evaluation using a standard ELISA assay.

However, in 2017, there was a noticeable reduction in reported dengue incidence cases within the Americas, including severe and fatal cases. Understanding the mechanism underlying dengue's incidence and decline in the Americas is vital for public health planning. We aimed to provide plausible explanations for the decline in 2017.Methods:An expert panel of representatives from scientific and academic institutions, Ministry of Health officials from Latin America and PAHO/WHO staff met in October 2017 to propose hypotheses. The meeting employed six moderated plenary discussions in which participants reviewed epidemiological evidence, suggested explanatory hypotheses, offered their expert opinions on each and developed a consensus.Results:The expert group established that in 2017, there was a generalised decreased incidence, severity and number of deaths due to dengue in the Americas, accompanied by a reduction in reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya virus infections, with no change in distribution among age groups affected. This decline was determined to be unlikely due to changes in epidemiological surveillance systems, as similar designs of surveillance systems exist across the region. Although sudden surveillance disruption is possible at a country or regional level, it is unlikely to occur in all countries simultaneously. Retrospective modelling with epidemiological, immunological and entomological information is needed. Host or immunological factors may have influenced the decline in dengue cases at the population level through immunity; however, herd protection requires additional evidence. Uncertainty remains regarding the effect on the outcome of sequential infections of different dengue virus (DENV) types and Zika virus (ZIKV), and vice versa. Future studies were recommended that examine the epidemiological effect of prior DENV infection on Zika incidence and severity, the epidemiological effect of prior Zika virus infection on dengue incidence and severity, immune correlates based on new-generation ELISA assays, and impact of prior DENV/other arbovirus infection on ZIKV immune response in relation to number of infections and the duration of antibodies in relation to interval of protection. Follow-up studies should also investigate whether increased vector control intensification activities contributed to the decline in transmission of one or more of these arboviruses. Additionally, proposed studies should focus on the potential role of vector competence when simultaneously exposed to various arboviruses, and on entomological surveillance and its impact on circulating vector species, with a goal of applying specific measures that mitigate seasonal occurrence or outbreaks.Conclusions:Multifactorial events may have accounted for the decline in dengue seen in 2017. Differing elements might explain the reduction in dengue including elements of immunity, increased vector control, and even vector and\or viruses changes or adaptations. Most of the results of this expert consensus group meeting are hypothetical and based on limited evidence. Further studies are needed."""

Bulk transcriptomics data are difficult to interpret because blood consists of multiple cell types that may react differently to infection. Here, we applied virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-seq approach (viscRNA-Seq) to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single PBMCs derived early in the course of disease from six dengue patients and four healthy controls and to characterize distinct leukocyte subtypes that harbor viral RNA (vRNA). Multiple IFN response genes, particularly MX2 in naive B cells and CD163 in CD14+CD16+monocytes, were up-regulated in a cell-specific manner before progression to SD. The majority of vRNA-containing cells in the blood of two patients who progressed to SD were naive IgM B cells expressing the CD69 and CXCR4 receptors and various antiviral genes, followed by monocytes. Bystander, non-vRNA-containing B cells also demonstrated immune activation, and IgG1 plasmablasts from two patients exhibited clonal expansions. Lastly, assembly of the DENV genome sequence revealed diversity at unexpected sites.

In this study, the mechanism of hair loss caused by DENV was explored. Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) are essential for hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. Thus, we established anin vitroDENV infection model in HFDPCs. On immunofluorescence analysis, HFDPCs that were susceptible to DENV infection responded to type I interferon (IFN) treatment, and the cells showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), revealed an inflammatory response in DENV-infected HFDPCs. In particular, DENV infection impaired cell viability, and it activated caspase-associated cell death signaling in HFDPCs. In conclusion, our data indicate that direct infection with DENV causes inflammation and cell death in HFDPCs, which is involved in the mechanisms of hair loss after DENV infection. The knowledge of DENV infection in an immune-privileged tissue, such as hair follicles, may suggest their use for further studies on post-dengue fatigue syndrome (PDFS)."""

Interestingly, female mosquitoes from larvae subjected to a stressed regime exhibited significantly reduced susceptibility to disseminated dengue infection 14days post infection compared to those subjected to optimal regimes. Short term survivorship post-infected blood feeding was not significantly different. As with body size, dengue virus susceptibility of a mosquito population is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors and is likely maintained by balancing selection. Here, we provide evidence that under different environmental conditions, the innate immune response of field-reared mosquitoes exhibits a large range of phenotypic variability with regard to dengue virus susceptibility. Further, as with body size, our results suggest that mosquitoes reared under optimal laboratory conditions, as employed in all mosquito-pathogen studies to date, may not always be realistic proxies for natural populations."""

Cytokines, which broadly also include chemokines and growth factors, have been shown to play a role in protective immunity as well as DENV and CHIKV pathogenesis. However, differences in cytokine response to both viruses remain poorly understood, especially in patients from countries where both viruses are endemic. Our study is therefore aimed to provide a comparative profiling of cytokine response induced by acute DENV and CHIKV infections in patients with similar disease stages and in experimental in vitro infections.Methods:By using multiplex immunoassay, we compared host cytokine profiles between acute CHIKV and DENV infections by analysing serum cytokine levels of IL-1α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, RANTES, MCP-3, eotaxin, PDGF-AB/BB, and FGF-2 from the sera of acute chikungunya and dengue fever patients. We further investigated the cytokine profile responses using experimental in vitro CHIKV and DENV infections of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).Results:We found that both CHIKV and DENV-infected patients had an upregulated level of IL-8 and IL-4, with the highest IL-4 level observed in DENV-2 infected patients. Higher IL-8 level was also correlated with lower platelet count in dengue patients. IL-13 and MCP-3 downregulation was observed only in chikungunya patients, while conversely PDGF-AB/BB and FGF-2 downregulation was unique in dengue patients. Age-associated differential expression of IL-13, MCP-3, and IL-5 was also observed, while distinct kinetics of IL-4, IL-8, and FGF-2 expression between CHIKV and DENV-infected patients were identified.

Downregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 was identified as a unique cytokine response profile of acute CHIKV infection, while distinct downregulation of PDGF-AB/BB and FGF-2 characterized the response from acute DENV infection.

The neutralization and enhancement activities of maternal antibodies against the virus are represented by a function derived from experimental data and knowledge from the medical literature. The analytic study of the model shows the existence of two equilibriums, a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic one. We performed the asymptotic stability analysis for these two equilibriums. The local asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium (DHF equilibrium) corresponds to the occurrence of DHF. Numerical results are also presented in order to illustrate the mathematical analysis performed, highlighting the most important parameters that drive model dynamics. We defined the age at which DHF occurs as the time when the infection takes off that means at the inflection point of the curve of infected cell population. We showed that this age corresponds to the one at which maximum enhancing activity for dengue infection appears. This critical time for the occurrence of DHF is calculated from the model to be approximately 2 months after the time for maternal dengue neutralizing antibodies to degrade below a protective level, which corresponds to what is observed in the experimental data from the literature."""

However, the roles that the P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway play in antiviral immunity inAe. albopictusand its midgut still need further exploration. This study aimed to explore the profiles of both viral-derived and host-originated piRNAs in the whole body and midgut infected with Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) inAe. albopictus, and to elucidate gene expression profile differences of the PIWI protein family between adult females and their midguts. A deep sequencing-based method was used to identify and analyze small non-coding RNAs, especially the piRNA profiles in DENV-2-infectedAe. albopictusand its midgut. The top-ranked, differentially-expressed piRNAs were further validated using Stem-loop qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analyses and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods were used to detect PIWI protein family members, and their expression profiles. DENV-2 derived piRNAs (vpiRNA, 24⁻30 nts) were observed in both infectedAe. albopictusand its midgut; however, only vpiRNA in the whole-body library had a weak preference for adenine at position 10 (10A) in the sense molecules as a feature of secondary piRNA. These vpiRNAs were not equally distributed, instead they were derived from a few specific regions of the genome, especially several hot spots, and displayed an obvious positive strand bias. We refer to the differentially expressed host piRNAs after DENV infection as virus-induced host endogenous piRNAs (vepiRNAs). However, we found that vepiRNAs were abundant in mosquito whole-body tissue, but deficient in the midgut. A total of eleven PIWI family genes were identified inAe. albopictus; however, only AalPiwi5⁻7 and AalAgo3(1⁻2) were readily detected in the midgut. The characteristics of piRNAs in DENV-2-infectedAe. albopictusadult females were similar to those previously described for flavivirus infections but were not observed in the midgut.

MC-γδ T cell conjugates were observed consistently in infected peripheral tissues, suggesting a new role for MCs as nonconventional APCs for γδ T cells. MC-dependent γδ T cell activation and proliferation during DENV infection required T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and the nonconventional antigen presentation molecule endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) on MCs. γδ T cells, not previously implicated in DENV host defense, killed infected targeted DCs and contributed to the clearance of DENV in vivo.

Portal tract and hepatic acinus presented high expression of TLR2, TLR3, IL6, and granzyme B. Hepatic acinus also presented iNOS, IL18, and TGF-beta. Cells expressing IL12, IL13, JAk1, STAT1, and NF-κB were rarely visualized. Treg cells foxp3+ were absent. TLR2 and TLR3 seem to participate in cellular activation and cytokine production. Cytotoxic response seems to play a role. Although TGF-beta promotes the activation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, IL6 can significantly suppresses their generation. The expression of Treg cells is diminished probably as a result of the high frequency of these cytokines.

Its antiviral activity was demonstrated in restricting HIV infection in vitro; however, the clinical implications remain controversial. Infection with dengue virus (DENV) is a global public health problem, and we lack an antiviral drug for DENV. Here, we evaluated the anti-DENV potential of treatment with HCQ. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that HCQ could inhibit DENV serotype 1-4 infection in vitro. RT-qPCR analysis of HCQ-treated cells showed induced expression of interferon (IFN)-related antiviral proteins and certain inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic study suggested that HCQ activated the innate immune signaling pathways of IFN-β, AP-1, and NFκB. Knocking down mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), inhibiting TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/inhibitor-κB kinase ɛ (IKKɛ), and blocking type I IFN receptor reduced the efficiency of HCQ against DENV-2 infection. Furthermore, HCQ significantly induced cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was involved in the host defense system. Suppression of ROS production attenuated the innate immune activation and anti-DENV-2 effect of HCQ. In summary, HCQ triggers the host defense machinery by inducing ROS- and MAVS-mediated innate immune activation against DENV infection and may be a candidate drug for DENV infection."""

A distinct feature of dengue is the increased risk for severe disease in some individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunity. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly-neutralizing IgG antibodies from a prior infection opsonize DENV to increase infection of Fcgamma receptor-bearing cells. While IgM and IgG are the most commonly studied DENV-reactive antibody isotypes, our group and others have described the induction of DENV-specific serum IgA responses during dengue. We hypothesized that monomeric IgA would be able to neutralize DENV without the possibility of ADE. To test this, we synthesized IgG and IgA versions of two different DENV-reactive monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that isotype-switching does not affect the antigen binding and neutralization properties of the two mAbs. We show that DENV-reactive IgG, but not IgA, mediates ADE in Fcgamma receptor-positive K562 cells. Furthermore, we show that IgA potently antagonizes the ADE activity of IgG. These results suggest that levels of DENV-reactive IgA induced by DENV infection might regulate the overall IgG mediated ADE activity of DENV-immune plasmain vivo, and may serve as a predictor of disease risk."""

The effect of chromium compromises the immune response of the host. Dengue virus (DV) infection causes various changes in the peripheral blood cells. It is, therefore, possible that the chromium toxicity may affect the disease process during DV infection. The present study aims to study the effects of dengue virus infection on peripheral blood cells of mice fed Cr (VI) with drinking water.Methods:One group of mice was given ad libitum drinking water containing Cr (VI) and the other group used as the normal control mice was given plain water to drink. At the 3, 6 and 9 wk of Cr (VI) drinking, a set of mice from each group was inoculated intracerebrally (ic) with DV and studied at the 4th and 8th day post inoculation.Results:It was observed that Cr (VI) drinking led to reduction in lymphocytes, haemoglobin and the haematocrit values while the granulocyte, monocyte and platelet counts were increased. On the other hand, most of the parameters were decreased following inoculation of normal mice with DV. In Cr (VI)-fed mice the effects of DV infection were minimal. The most significant finding of these experiments was that the reduction in platelet counts following inoculation with DV was markedly less in Cr (VI)-fed mice than that in DV-inoculated normal control mice.Interpretation & conclusion:Cr(VI) compounds have been declared as a potent occupational carcinogen. On the contrary, Cr(III) salts such as chromium polynicotinate, chromium chloride and chromium picolinate, are used as micronutrients and nutritional supplements, and have been shown to exhibit health benefits in animals and humans. Whether therapeutic doses of chromium (III) compounds may be able to prevent the DV-induced fall in platelet counts, needs to be investigated."""

This was an analytical cross-sectional study carried out in JIPMER hospital, Puducherry. Forty-four patients with dengue infection as cases and 44 patients with non dengue acute other febrile illness(OFI) as controls were recruited. Peripheral venous blood was withdrawn on day of admission, day 3 post admission and day of discharge and serological tests for NS1 dengue antigen and anti IgM antibody were analyzed for diagnosis of dengue infection. Platelet rich plasma was assessed for DC SIGN, FcϒR2A levels and platelets separated from dengue patients were subjected to RNA extraction and detection of presence of viral RNA. The study observed a decreased expression of DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A on platelets in dengue patients compared to OFI group on all the time points. Further, cells expressing DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A were found to be decreased on platelets in dengue patients who were positive for NS1 antigen. DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A expression was also found to be notably decreased in patients positive for platelet DENV RNA when compared with patients negative for platelet DENV RNA. Our results suggest that DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A, which are receptors for viral capture and immune mediated clearance respectively, might be down regulated on platelets in patients with dengue infection. The decreased receptor expression diminishes platelet activation and subsequently has protective action on the host from the ongoing conflict between immune system and dengue virus."""

Elevated levels of galectin-9 (Gal-9) in natural human infections have been documented in numerous reports. To investigate the effect of dengue virus (DENV) infection on expression of endogenous Gal-9, monocytic THP-1 cells were infected with varying doses of DENV-3 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1) and incubated at varying time points (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3).

Studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) affect transcription and/or expression; and therefore, may influence the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, such as dengue. Consequently, the objective of this study was to assess through a case-control study whether there was an association between the presence of SNPs -308G/A and -238G/A in the TNF-α gene and 158 patients with dengue and 123 controls. No association was found between the SNPs and the dengue cases in the study population. We then performed a meta-analysis, retrieving data from case-control studies in the literature for the same polymorphisms. For SNP-308G/A, the GG genotype was associated with dengue fever (DF) risk (OR = 1.24, 1.00-1.53; p = 0.05; I2= 0%), while the GA genotype (OR = 0.75, 0.60-0.93; p = 0.01; I2= 0%) and allele A (OR = 0.75, 0.60-0.93; p = 0.01; I2= 0%) were associated with protection.

Here we present a new computational method for identifying putative host protein targets of the dengue virus protease. Our method relies on biochemical and secondary structure features at the known cleavage sites in the viral polyprotein in a two-stage classification process to identify putative cleavage targets. The accuracy of our predictions scaled inversely with evolutionary distance when we applied it to the known cleavage sites of several other flaviviruses-a good indication of the validity of our predictions.

Particularly, the effect of stress on the immune response to infection is of interest to public health because of its implications for vaccine efficacy and treatment strategies during stressful scenarios. Severe stress has previously been shown to cause an anergic state in the immune system that persists following exposure to a potent mitogen.Methods:Transcriptome and microRNA changes were characterized using blood samples collected from U.S. Army Ranger candidates immediately before and after training, followed by exposure to representative pathogenic agents: Yersinia pestis, dengue virus 2, and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). We employed experimental and computational approaches to characterize altered gene expression, processes, pathways, and regulatory networks mediating the host's response towards severe stress; to assess the protective immunity status of the stressed host towards infection; and to identify pathogen-induced biomarkers under severe stress conditions.Results:We observed predicted inhibition of pathways significantly associated with lymphopoiesis, wound healing, inflammatory response, lymphocyte activation, apoptosis, and predicted activation of oxidative stress. Using weighted correlation network analyses, we demonstrated preservation of these pathways across infection and stress combinations. Regulatory networks comprising a common set of upstream regulators: transcription factors, microRNAs and post-translational regulators (kinases and phosphatases) may be drivers of molecular alterations leading to compromised protective immunity. Other sets of transcripts were persistently altered in both the pre- and post-stress conditions due to the host's response to each pathogenic agent, forming specific molecular signatures with the potential to distinguish infection from that of severe stress.Conclusions:Our results suggest that severe stress alters molecules implicated in the development of leukopoietic stem cells, thereby leading to depletion of cellular and molecular repertoires of protective immunity. Suppressed molecules mediating membrane trafficking of recycling endosomes, membrane translocation and localization of the antigen processing mechanisms and cell adhesions indicate suboptimal antigen presentation, impaired formation of productive immunological synapses, and inhibited T-cell activations. These factors may collectively be responsible for compromised protective immunity (infection susceptibility, delayed wound healing, and poor vaccine response) observed in people under severe stress."""

Contributing to this research, patterns of viral load in dengue infected patients have been quantified, with analyses indicating that peak viral load levels, rates of viral load decline, and time to peak viremia are useful predictors of severe disease. Here, we take a complementary approach to understanding patterns of clinical manifestation and inter-individual variation in viral load dynamics. Specifically, we statistically fit mathematical within-host models of dengue to individual-level viral load data to test virological and immunological hypotheses explaining inter-individual variation in dengue viral load. We choose between alternative models using model selection criteria to determine which hypotheses are best supported by the data. We first show that the cellular immune response plays an important role in regulating viral load in secondary dengue infections. We then provide statistical support for the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (but not original antigenic sin) in the development of severe disease in secondary dengue infections.

Each of these Wolbachia strains interferes with viral pathogenicity and/or dissemination in both their natural Drosophila host and in their new mosquito host, and it has been suggested that this virus interference may be due to host immune priming by Wolbachia. In order to identify aspects of the mosquito immune response that might underpin virus interference, we used whole-genome microarrays to analyse the transcriptional response of A. aegypti to the wMel and wMelPop-CLA Wolbachia strains. While wMel affected the transcription of far fewer host genes than wMelPop-CLA, both strains activated the expression of some immune genes including anti-microbial peptides, Toll pathway genes and genes involved in melanization. Because the induction of these immune genes might be associated with the very recent introduction of Wolbachia into the mosquito, we also examined the same Wolbachia strains in their original host D. melanogaster. First we demonstrated that when dengue viruses were injected into D. melanogaster, virus accumulation was significantly reduced in the presence of Wolbachia, just as in A. aegypti. Second, when we carried out transcriptional analyses of the same immune genes up-regulated in the new heterologous mosquito host in response to Wolbachia we found no over-expression of these genes in D. melanogaster, infected with either wMel or wMelPop. These results reinforce the idea that the fundamental mechanism involved in viral interference in Drosophila and Aedes is not dependent on the up-regulation of the immune effectors examined, although it cannot be excluded that immune priming in the heterologous mosquito host might enhance the virus interference trait."""

Intriguingly, flavivirus infection resulted in a significant loss of peroxisomes, an effect that may be due in part to capsid expression. We posited that capsid protein-mediated sequestration and/or degradation of Pex19 results in loss of peroxisomes, a situation that could result in reduced early antiviral signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that induction of the lambda interferon mRNA in response to a viral RNA mimic was reduced by more than 80%. Together, our findings indicate that inhibition of peroxisome biogenesis may be a novel mechanism by which flaviviruses evade the innate immune system during early stages of infection.Importance:RNA viruses infect hundreds of millions of people each year, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Chief among these pathogens are the flaviviruses, which include dengue virus and West Nile virus. Despite their medical importance, there are very few prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for these viruses. Moreover, the manner in which they subvert the innate immune response in order to establish infection in mammalian cells is not well understood. Recently, peroxisomes were reported to function in early antiviral signaling, but very little is known regarding if or how pathogenic viruses affect these organelles. We report for the first time that flavivirus infection results in significant loss of peroxisomes in mammalian cells, which may indicate that targeting of peroxisomes is a key strategy used by viruses to subvert early antiviral defenses."""

DENV infections can range from unrecognizable illnesses to a spectrum of clinical manifestations such as dengue fever (DF), and more severe and potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The variability of clinical manifestations induced by DENV can be attributed to a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic factors including virulence of the DENV strains and host genetic factors influencing the immune response. Interferon gamma (IFN-Y) is one of the critical immunomodulators implicated in DENV infection, and recent case-control association studies examined the role of +874 T/A polymorphism (rs2430561) of the IFN-Y gene in dengue clinical outcomes. Since the results of the association studies on DENV infection and IFN-Y +874 T/A polymorphism were inconsistent, we performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimate of the association. Searching the databases until 15 March 2020, we identified five studies with a total of 1412 subjects (582 cases and 830 controls), which were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the association. Pooled data indicated significant association of the TT genotype with DENV infection (DI), DF, and DHF in the recessive model TT vs AT+AA: OR (DI) = 1.47, 95% CI (1.10-1.97),P= 0.01; OR (DF) = 1.40, 95% CI (1.00-1.94),P= 0.04, OR (DHF) = 1.73, 95% CI (1.05-2.86),P= 0.03, and the genotype contrast TT vs AT: OR (DI) = 1.70, 95% CI (1.18-2.47);P= 0.005, OR (DF) = 1.72, 95% CI (1.12-2.66),P= 0.014, OR (DHF) = 1.76, 95% CI (1.01-3.06),P= 0.046.

It produces numerous immune factors, as well as immune-modulatory, vasodilatory, and anti-coagulant molecules that facilitate blood-feeding. To assess the impact of DENV infection on salivary gland physiology and function, we performed a comparative genome-wide microarray analysis of the naïve and DENV infection-responsive A. aegypti salivary gland transcriptomes. DENV infection resulted in the regulation of 147 transcripts that represented a variety of functional classes, including several that are essential for virus transmission, such as immunity, blood-feeding, and host-seeking. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of three DENV infection-responsive genes--a cathepsin B, a putative cystatin, and a hypothetical ankyrin repeat-containing protein--significantly modulated DENV replication in the salivary gland. Furthermore, silencing of two DENV infection-responsive odorant-binding protein genes (OBPs) resulted in an overall compromise in blood acquisition from a single host by increasing the time for initiation of probing and the probing time before a successful bloodmeal. We also show that DENV established an extensive infection in the mosquito's main olfactory organs, the antennae, which resulted in changes of the transcript abundance of key host-seeking genes. DENV infection, however, did not significantly impact probing initiation or probing times in our laboratory infection system. Here we show for the first time that the mosquito salivary gland mounts responses to suppress DENV which, in turn, modulates the expression of chemosensory-related genes that regulate feeding behavior.

Here, we combined cell fractionation, ribosome profiling, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the subcellular organization of viral genome translation and replication as well as host cell translation and its response to DENV infection. We report that throughout the viral life cycle, DENV plus- and minus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), identifying the ER as the primary site of DENV translation. DENV infection was accompanied by an ER compartment-specific remodeling of translation, where ER translation capacity was subverted from host transcripts to DENV plus-strand RNA, particularly at late stages of infection. Remarkably, translation levels and patterns in the cytosol compartment were only modestly affected throughout the experimental time course of infection. Comparisons of ribosome footprinting densities of the DENV plus-strand RNA and host mRNAs indicated that DENV plus-strand RNA was only sparsely loaded with ribosomes. Combined, these observations suggest a mechanism where ER-localized translation and translational control mechanisms, likelycisencoded, are used to repurpose the ER for DENV virion production. Consistent with this view, we found ER-linked cellular stress response pathways commonly associated with viral infection, namely, the interferon response and unfolded protein response, to be only modestly activated during DENV infection. These data support a model where DENV reprograms the ER protein synthesis and processing environment to promote viral survival and replication while minimizing the activation of antiviral and proteostatic stress response pathways.IMPORTANCEDENV, a prominent human health threat with no broadly effective or specific treatment, depends on host cell translation machinery for viral replication, immune evasion, and virion biogenesis. The molecular mechanism by which DENV commandeers the host cell protein synthesis machinery and the subcellular organization of DENV replication and viral protein synthesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER. Surprisingly, DENV infection largely affects only ER-associated translation, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol. DENV RNA translation is very inefficient, likely representing a strategy to minimize disruption of ER proteostasis. Overall these findings demonstrate that DENV has evolved an ER-compartmentalized life cycle; thus, targeting the molecular signatures and regulation of the DENV-ER interaction landscape may reveal strategies for therapeutic intervention."""

Host demography has been shown to directly affect the period between epidemics in other pathogen systems, therefore, one might expect unsynchronized multi-annual cycles occurring in hosts with dramatically different birth rates and life spans. However, in Senegal, we observe a single synchronized eight-year cycle across all vector species, suggesting synchronized dynamics in all vertebrate hosts. In the current study, we aim to explore two specific hypotheses: 1) primates with different demographics will experience outbreaks of dengue at different periodicities when observed as isolated systems, and that coupling of these subsystems through mosquito biting will act to synchronize incidence; and 2) the eight-year periodicity of isolations observed across multiple primate species is the result of long-term cycling in population immunity in the host populations. To test these hypotheses, we develop a multi-host, multi-vector Susceptible, Infected, Removed (SIR) model to explore the effects of coupling multiple host-vector systems of dengue virus transmission through cross-species biting rates. We find that under small amounts of coupling, incidence in the host species synchronize. Long-period multi-annual dynamics are observed only when prevalence in troughs reaches vanishingly small levels (< 10(-10)), suggesting that these dynamics are inconsistent with sustained transmission in this setting, but are consistent with local dengue virus extinctions followed by reintroductions. Inclusion of a constant introduction of infectious individuals into the system causes the multi-annual periods to shrink, while the effects of coupling remain the same. Inclusion of a stochastic rate of introduction allows for multi-annual periods at a cost of reduced synchrony. Thus, we conclude that the eight-year period separating amplifications of dengue may be explained by cycling in immunity with stochastic introductions."""

We employed various techniques like Western blot, Confocal microscopy, RT-PCR to show that STAT3 acts as a pro-viral factor for DV-2 propagation. As per result of the present study STAT3 is upregulated as well as activated by phosphorylation in DV-2 infected A549 cells. Additionally, STAT3 knockdown led to a significant decrease in expression of viral proteins as well as viral replication. We show that DV-2 strategically tweaks STAT3 which is a negative regulator of Type I IFN signaling, in order to evade host Type I and Type III interferon response by upregulating its expression and activation. Our results demonstrate the proviral role of STAT3 for DV-2 propagation which is correlated to activation by tyrosine phosphorylation.

We assayed these sites 3 h postinoculation with transcript arrays for the Toll-like receptor (TLR), RIG-I-like receptor, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways of the innate immune system. We then chose TLR7, transcription factor p65 (RelA), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) from the arrays for further investigation and assayed these transcripts at 10 min, 3 h, and 6 h postinoculation. The transcripts for TLR7, RelA, IFN-γ, and IP-10 were significantly downregulated between 2- and 3-fold in the group subjected to mosquito probing relative to the virus-only inoculation group at 3 h postinoculation. A reduction in these transcripts could indicate reduced DENV recognition and antigen presentation and diminished inhibition of viral replication and spread.

Several key observations have been made which shed light onto this phenomenon particularly that antibodies can enhance Fc receptor-dependent uptake of virus into macrophages thereby increasing virus replication. Furthermore there seems to be a relationship between the peak virus load and disease severity. However, a second key feature of dengue is that the life-threatening symptoms do not correlate with the period of high viraemia; instead they occur at a time when the virus load is in steep decline. The coincidence of severe disease manifestations with defervescence and virus control suggests that the symptoms may be a consequence of the immune response to the virus rather than virus induced cytopathology. One of the key elements in the immune response to viruses are T cells which can both secrete a host of inflammatory cytokines and also be directly cytotoxic to infected cells. There are a number of experimental models of T cell-induced immunopathology including in responses to viruses. Particularly interesting in this respect are models of RSV-induced immunopathology, which have direct relevance to vaccine design as a formalin-inactivated vaccine to RSV actually enhanced disease in children when they became naturally infected with RSV, an echo of the disease enhancement seen in dengue. We will present an analysis of CD8+ T cell responses to a number of novel T cell epitopes during dengue infection and also analyse the function and cytokine secretion of these cells.

The assessment of the heterogeneity of viral dynamics in dengue-infected patients and its precise treatment are still uncertain. Infection onset, patient physiology and immune response are thought to play major roles in the development of the viral load. Research has explored the interference and spontaneous generation of defective virus particles, but have not examined both the antibody and defective particles during natural infection. We explore the intrinsic variability in the within-host dynamics of viraemias for a population of patients using the method of population of models (POMs). A dataset from 208 patients is used to initially calibrate 20,000 models for the infection kinetics for each of the four dengue virus serotypes. The calibrated POMs suggests that naturally generated defective particles may interfere with the viraemia, but the generated defective virus particles are not adequate to reduce high fever and viraemia duration. The effect of adding excess defective dengue virus interfering particles to patients as a therapeutic is evaluated using the calibrated POMs in a bang-bang (on-off or two-step) optimal control setting. Bang-bang control is a class of binary feedback control that turns either 'ON' or 'OFF' at different time points, determined by the system feedback. Here, the bang-bang control estimates the mathematically optimal dose and duration of the intervention for each model in the POM set."""

Type I interferons (IFNs) represent an initial and essential host defense response against viruses. DENV has been reported to trigger a robust type I IFN response; however, IFN-α/β profile in the progression of disease is not well characterized.Objectives and study design:In this context, we conducted a retrospective study assessing the circulating serum levels of type I IFNs and related cytokines at different phases of illness in children during the 2011 outbreak of DENV in Paraguay. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and virological data were analyzed.Results:During defervescence, significantly higher levels of IFN-β, IL-6 and MIP-1β, were detected in severe vs. non-severe dengue patients. Additionally, a significant positive correlation between INF-α and viremia was detected in children with severe dengue. A significant positive correlation was also observed between IFN-β serum levels and hematocrit during the febrile phase, whereas IFN-α levels negatively correlated with white blood cells during defervescence in severe dengue patients. Furthermore, previous serologic status of patients to DENV did not influence type I IFN production.Conclusions:The distinct type I IFN profile in children with dengue and severe dengue, as well as its association with viral load, cytokine production and laboratory manifestations indicate differences in innate and adaptive immune responses that should be investigated further in order to unveil the association of immunological and physiological pathways that underlie in DENV infection."""

Three biological replicates for each timepoint [2, 4 and 9 days post-exposure (dpe)] and treatment group allowed us to remove the outliers associated with sample-to-sample variability. Using edgeR (R Bioconductor), designed for use with replicate deep sequencing data, we determined the log fold-change (logFC) of miRNA levels [18-23 nucleotides (nt)]. The number of significantly modulated miRNAs increased from ≤ 5 at 2 and 4 dpe to 23 unique miRNAs by 9 dpe. Putative miRNA targets were predicted by aligning miRNAs to the transcriptome, and the list was reduced to include the intersection of hits found using the Miranda, PITA, and TargetScan algorithms. To further reduce false-positives, putative targets were validated by cross-checking them with mRNAs reported in recent DENV2 host response transcriptome reports; 4076 targets were identified. Of these, 464 gene targets have predicted miRNA-binding sites in 3' untranslated regions. Context-specific target functional groups include proteins involved in transport, transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial function, chromatin modification and signal transduction processes known to be required for viral replication and dissemination. The miRNA response is placed in context with other vector host response studies by comparing the predicted targets with those of transcriptome studies.

We compared model predictions with reported dengue data January to December, 2020, and assessed if deviations from projected incidence since March, 2020 are associated with specific public health and social measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracer database) or human movement behaviours (as measured by Google mobility reports).Findings:We found a consistent, prolonged decline in dengue incidence across many dengue-endemic regions that began in March, 2020 (2·28 million cases in 2020 vs 4·08 million cases in 2019; a 44·1% decrease). We found a strong association between COVID-19-related disruption (as measured independently by public health and social measures and human movement behaviours) and reduced dengue risk, even after taking into account other drivers of dengue cycles including climatic and host immunity (relative risk 0·01-0·17, p<0·01). Measures related to the closure of schools and reduced time spent in non-residential areas had the strongest evidence of association with reduced dengue risk, but high collinearity between covariates made specific attribution challenging. Overall, we estimate that 0·72 million (95% CI 0·12-1·47) fewer dengue cases occurred in 2020 potentially attributable to COVID-19-related disruption.Interpretation:In most countries, COVID-19-related disruption led to historically low dengue incidence in 2020.

The production of highly mature virions principally relies on the structure and function of the viral premature membrane protein (prM) and its cleavage by the host protease furin. We redeveloped a reliable clonal cell line (VF1) which produces single-round mature DENVs without the need for DENV reverse genetics. More importantly, using protein engineering and directed evolution of the prM cleavage site, we engineered genetically stable mature DENVs in all serotypes independent of cell or host, usually with minimal impact on viral yield. Using these complementary strategies to regulate maturation, we demonstrate that the resulting mature DENVs are antigenically distinct from their isogenic partially mature forms. Given the clinical importance of mature DENVs in immunity, our study provides reliable strategies and reagents for the production of stable, high-titer mature DENVs for DENV antibody neutralization and vaccination immunity studies.

The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV has recently been shown to cleave the antiviral protein STING and thereby subvert the innate immune signaling to facilitate virus replication. Whether host cells have a mechanism to counteract this virus-mediated immunosuppression is unclear. We discovered that the K27-linked polyubiquitination of NS3 protein facilitates its recruitment of NS2B, the formation of NS2B3, and consequently the enhanced cleavage of STING. However, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, SCAP, through binding to NS2B protein, inhibits the ubiquitination of NS3, rendering NS2B3 protease incapable of binding and cleaving STING. Importantly, ectopic expression of SCAP impaired DENV infection, whereas silencing of SCAP potentiated DENV infection. Collectively, this study uncovered a novel function of SCAP of counteracting the inhibitory action of DENV NS2B3 protease on STING signaling, suggesting that modulation of SCAP levels may have therapeutic implications.IMPORTANCEThis study reports the first ubiquitylation target protein in DENV, the NS3 protein, and the unique role of K27-linked polyubiquitylation in NS3's ability to recruit NS2B and formation of the NS2B3 protease complex.

However, the roles of viral protein SUMOylation in dengue virus (DENV) infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation. By in vivo and in vitro SUMOylation assays, the DENV NS5 protein was identified as an authentic SUMO-targeted protein. By expressing various NS5 mutants, we found that the SUMO acceptor sites are located in the N-terminal domain of NS5 and that a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of this domain is crucial for its SUMOylation. A DENV replicon harboring the SUMOylation-defective SIM mutant showed a severe defect in viral RNA replication, supporting the notion that NS5 SUMOylation is required for DENV replication. SUMOylation-defective mutants also failed to suppress the induction of STAT2-mediated host antiviral interferon signaling. Furthermore, the SUMOylation of NS5 significantly increased the stability of NS5 protein, which could account for most of the biological functions of SUMOylated NS5. Collectively, these findings suggest that the SUMOylation of DENV NS5 is one of the mechanisms regulating DENV replication.Importance:SUMOylation is a common posttranslational modification that regulates cellular protein functions but has not been reported in the proteins of dengue virus. Here, we found that the replicase of DENV, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), can be SUMOylated. It is well known that providing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and antagonizing host antiviral IFN signaling are a """"double indemnity"""" of NS5 to support DENV replication. Without SUMOylation, NS5 fails to maintain its protein stability, which consequently disrupts its function in viral RNA replication and innate immunity antagonism. DENV threatens billions of people worldwide, but no licensed vaccine or specific therapeutics are currently available. Thus, our findings suggest that rather than specifically targeting NS5 enzyme activity, NS5 protein stability is a novel drug target on the growing list of anti-DENV strategies."""

Overexpression of Dome and Hop resulted in profound transcriptome regulation in the fat body tissue as well as the midgut tissue, pinpointing several expression signatures that reflect mechanisms of DENV restriction.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of α-MG.

In conclusion, this study revealed a reduction in CR2 levels in dengue patients and that the CR1 SNP rs6691117A/G is associated with the dengue severity. The correlation of CR2 levels with platelet counts suggests that CR2 could be an additional biomarker for the prognosis of severe dengue disease."""

To examine its antigenic relationship to DENV-4, we assessed serum neutralizing and protective activity. Whereas DENV-4-immune mouse sera neutralize DKE-121 infection, DKE-121-immune sera inhibit DENV-4 less efficiently. Passive transfer of DENV-4 or DKE-121-immune sera protects mice against homologous, but not heterologous, DENV-4 or DKE-121 challenge. Antigenic cartography suggests that DENV-4 and DKE-121 are related but antigenically distinct. However, DENV-4 vaccination confers protection against DKE-121 in nonhuman primates, and serum from humans immunized with a tetravalent vaccine neutralize DENV-4 and DKE-121 infection equivalently.

Generally, immunity after infection with one serotype is protective and lifelong, though exceptions have been described. However, secondary infection with a different serotype can result in more severe disease for a minority of patients. Host responses to the first DENV infection involve the development of both cross-reactive antibody and T cell responses, which, depending upon their precise balance, may mediate protection or enhance disease upon secondary infection with a different serotype. Abundant evidence now exists that responses elicited by DENV infection can cross-react with other members of the genus Flavivirus, particularly Zika virus (ZIKV). Cohort studies have shown that prior DENV immunity is associated with protection against Zika. Cross-reactive antibody responses may enhance infection with flaviviruses, which likely accounts for the cases of severe disease seen during secondary DENV infections. Data for T cell responses are contradictory, and even though cross-reactive T cell responses exist, their clinical significance is uncertain. Recent mouse experiments, however, show that cross-reactive T cells are capable of mediating protection against ZIKV. In this review, we summarize and discuss the evidence that T cell responses may, at least in part, explain the cross-protection seen against ZIKV from DENV infection, and that T cell antigens should therefore be included in putative Zika vaccines."""

Depletion of NK cells or neutralization of IFN-γ leads to increased viremia and more severe thrombocytopenia and liver damage in humanized mice.In vitrostudies using autologous human NK cells show that DENV-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), but not monocytes, activate NK cells in a contact-dependent manner, resulting in upregulation of CD69 and CD25 and secretion of IFN-γ. Blocking adhesion molecules (LFA-1, DNAM-1, CD2, and 2β4) on NK cells abolishes NK cell activation, IFN-γ secretion, and the control of DENV replication. NK cells activated by infected MDDCs also inhibit DENV infection in monocytes.

There are indications thatBorreliaactively influence the B cell immune response and that it is therefore not directly comparable to responses induced by other infections. The main goal of this study was to identify B cell features that could be used to support diagnosis of Borreliosis. Therefore, we characterized the B cell immune response in these patients by combining multicolor flow cytometry, singleBorrelia-reactiveB cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, and B cell repertoire deep sequencing. Our phenotyping experiments showed, that there is no significant difference between B cell subpopulations of acute Borreliosis patients and controls. BCR sequences from individual epitope-reactive B cells had little in common between each other. HTS showed, however, a higher complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) amino acid (aa) sequence overlap between samples from different timepoints in patients as compared to controls. This indicates, that HTS is sensitive enough to detect ongoing B cell immune responses in these patients. Although each individual's repertoire was dominated by rather unique clones, clustering of bulk BCR repertoire sequences revealed a higher overlap of IgG BCR repertoire sequences between acute patients than controls.

Finally, we consider dengue virulence evolution when selection acts on the virus's production rate. By combining within-host model simulations with empirical findings on how host viral load affects human-to-mosquito transmission success, we show that the virus's transmission potential is maximized at production rates associated with intermediate virulence and that the optimal production rate critically depends on dengue's epidemiological context.

A single mechanism that might explain this broad-based pathogen protection is immune priming, in which the presence of the symbiont upregulates the basal immune response, preparing the insect to defend against subsequent pathogen infection. A study that compared natural Wolbachia infections in Drosophila melanogaster with the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti artificially transinfected with the same strains has suggested that innate immune priming may only occur in recent host-Wolbachia associations. This same study also revealed that while immune priming may play a role in viral protection it cannot explain the entirety of the effect.Methodology/findings:Here we assess whether the level of innate immune priming induced by different Wolbachia strains in A. aegypti is correlated with the degree of protection conferred against bacterial pathogens. We show that Wolbachia strains wMel and wMelPop, currently being tested for field release for dengue biocontrol, differ in their protective abilities. The wMelPop strain provides stronger, more broad-based protection than wMel, and this is likely explained by both the higher induction of immune gene expression and the strain-specific activation of particular genes. We also show that Wolbachia densities themselves decline during pathogen infection, likely as a result of the immune induction.Conclusions/significance:This work shows a correlation between innate immune priming and bacterial protection phenotypes. The ability of the Toll pathway, melanisation and antimicrobial peptides to enhance viral protection or to provide the basis of malaria protection should be further explored in the context of this two-strain comparison. This work raises the questions of whether Wolbachia may improve the ability of wild mosquitoes to survive pathogen infection or alter the natural composition of gut flora, and thus have broader consequences for host fitness."""

Puzzling low incidence numbers and milder, non-fatal disease have been observed in Thailand and its Southeast (SE) Asian neighbors. Elusive genetic mechanisms might be operative, as a multitude of genetic factors are widely shared between the SE Asian populations, such as the more than 60 different thalassemia syndromes (principally dominated by the HbE trait). In this study, we have plotted COVID-19 infection and death rates in SE Asian (SEA) countries against heterozygote HbE and thalassemia carrier prevalence. COVID-19 infection and death incidence numbers appear inversely correlated with the prevalence of HbE and thalassemia heterozygote populations. We posit that the evolutionary protective effect of the HbE and other thalassemic variants against malaria and the dengue virus may extend its advantage to resistance to COVID-19 infection, as HbE heterozygote population prevalence appears to be positively correlated with immunity to COVID-19. Host immune system modulations induce antiviral interferon responses and alter structural protein integrity, thereby inhibiting cellular access and viral replication. These changes are possibly engendered by HbE carrier miRNAs. Proving this hypothesis is important, as it may shed light on the mechanism of viral resistance and lead to novel antiviral treatments. This development can thus guide decision-making and action to prevent COVID-19 infection."""

Even though the degree of thrombocytopenia and platelet activation were similar between dengue-infected and HIV plus dengue-coinfected patients, plasma levels of the platelet-derived chemokines RANTES/CCL5 and PF4/CXCL4 were lower in coinfection. Consistently, platelets from coinfected patients presented defective secretion of the stored-chemokines PF4 and RANTES, but not newly synthesized IL-1β, when cultured ex vivo.

Exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, the specific infecting DENV strains, and the interval of time between infections, as well as age, ethnicity, genetic polymorphisms, and comorbidities of the host, are all risk factors for severe dengue. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are thought to provide long-lived protection against symptomatic infection and severe dengue. The objective of dengue vaccines is to provide balanced protection against all DENV serotypes simultaneously. However, the association between homotypic and heterotypic NAb titers and protection against symptomatic infection remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the titer of preinfection cross-reactive NAbs correlates with reduced likelihood of symptomatic secondary infection in a longitudinal pediatric dengue cohort in Nicaragua. The protective effect of NAb titers on infection outcome remained significant when controlled for age, number of years between infections, and epidemic force, as well as with relaxed or more stringent criteria for defining inapparent DENV infections. Further, individuals with higher NAb titers immediately after primary infection had delayed symptomatic infections compared with those with lower titers. However, overall NAb titers increased modestly in magnitude and remained serotype cross-reactive in the years between infections, possibly due to reexposure. These findings establish that anti-DENV NAb titers correlate with reduced probability of symptomatic DENV infection and provide insights into longitudinal characteristics of antibody-mediated immunity to DENV in an endemic setting."""

The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the mRNAs adjacent to the DE lncRNAs were closely related to the host responses to viral infection. We selected 7 lncRNAs from the top 50 hits for validation. The quantitative real-time PCR data confirmed that expression of selected lncRNAs was induced by ZIKV infection. Moreover, the expression of 7 lncRNAs was induced by infection of dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, or vesicular stomatitis virus, or by treatment of poly(I:C) and IFN-β. Furthermore, loss of innate immune adaptor IPS-1 or receptor IFNAR1 resulted in lower induction levels of several lncRNAs by ZIKV. Overexpression of 3 lncRNAs (RPL27-OT1, OASL-IT1, and REC8-OT3) reduced the virus yields of ZIKV. Knockout of OASL-IT1 significantly enhanced ZIKV replication. In OASL-IT1 knockout cells, the levels of interferons (IFNs) and the activation of 3 innate immune signaling pathways triggered by ZIKV were dramatically reduced.

Research on host contributions to the ecology of arboviral diseases has been undertaken within multiple subdisciplines, but significant gaps in knowledge remain and multidisciplinary approaches are needed. Through our multidisciplinary review of the literature we have identified five broad areas where hosts may influence the ecology of arboviral transmission: host immunity; cross-protective immunity and antibody-dependent enhancement; host abundance; host diversity; and pathogen spillover and dispersal. Herein we discuss the known and theoretical roles of hosts within these topics and then apply this knowledge to three epidemiologically important mosquito-borne arboviruses that occur in Australia: dengue virus (DENV), Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), and Ross River virus (RRV). We argue that the underlying mechanisms by which hosts influence arboviral activity are numerous and attempts to delineate these mechanisms further are needed. Investigations that focus on hosts of vector-borne diseases are likely to be rewarding, particularly where the ecology of vectors is relatively well understood. From an applied perspective, enhanced knowledge of host influences upon vector-borne disease transmission is likely to enable better management of disease burden.

Infection in conditions of unfolded protein response priming leads to early activation of innate antiviral responses and cell intrinsic inhibition of viral replication, which is interferon regulatory factor 3 dependent.

These findings have pivotal implications while interpreting ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations, diagnostic results interpretation and vaccine designs and schedules among others."""

Our live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, KD-382, was developed using a classical host range mutation strategy (no addition of artificial genetic modification). In our previous study, cynomolgus monkeys immunized with a single dose of KD-382 seroconverted to all four serotypes. However, it is important to determine if neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) induced by KD-382 can work as a long-lasting immune response to prevent dengue. In this study, a single dose of KD-382 induced a strong NAb response against all four serotypes in cynomolgus monkeys. We also confirmed that NAb titers against all four serotypes persist for at least five years, indicating its high potential as a dengue vaccine candidate. Next, we evaluated the effect of pre-existing dengue immunity on NAb responses induced by KD-382. We administered KD-382 to cynomolgus monkeys pre-administered one of the monovalent parental wild-type strains 60 days before vaccination. Regardless of the pre-immunized serotype, all the monkeys showed sufficient tetravalent NAb responses, which lasted for over two years. All the KD-382 vaccinated monkeys were then challenged with different parental wild-type viruses than that used for pre-administration; viral RNA in the serum was less than the lower limit of quantification, indicating complete protection against secondary heterologous dengue infection without any harmful disease enhancement. Consequently, KD-382 successfully induced a long-lasting and protective tetravalent NAb response in monkeys, suggesting that KD-382 is a promising vaccine candidate usable for both dengue seronegative and seropositive individuals."""

Depending on the purpose and level of organization, infection at the organism level can be described by a process as simple as a coin toss, or as complex as a multi-factorial dynamic model; the former, for instance, may be adequate as a component of a population model, while the latter is necessary for a thorough description of the process beginning with a challenge with an infectious inoculum up to establishment or elimination of the pathogen. Experimental readouts in the laboratory are often static, snapshots of the process, assayed under some convenient experimental condition, and therefore cannot comprehensively describe the system. Different from the discrete treatment of infection in population models, or the descriptive summarized accounts of typical lab experiments, in this manuscript, infection is treated as a dynamic process dependent on the initial conditions of the infectious challenge, viral growth, and the host response along time. Here, experimental data is generated for multiple doses of type 1 dengue virus, and pathogen levels are recorded at different points in time for two populations of mosquitoes: either carrying endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia or not. A dynamic microbe/host-response mathematical model is used to describe pathogen growth in the face of a host response like the immune system, and to infer model parameters for the two populations of insects, revealing a slight-but potentially important-protection conferred by the symbiont."""

Because dendritic cells (DC) in the skin and blood are the first target cells for DENV, we sought to investigate the early molecular events involved in the host response to the virus in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC). Using a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of DENV2-infected human Mo-DC, three major responses were identified within hours of infection - the activation of IRF3/7/STAT1 and NF-κB-driven antiviral and inflammatory networks, as well as the stimulation of an oxidative stress response that included the stimulation of an Nrf2-dependent antioxidant gene transcriptional program. DENV2 infection resulted in the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was dependent on NADPH-oxidase (NOX). A decrease in ROS levels through chemical or genetic inhibition of the NOX-complex dampened the innate immune responses to DENV infection and facilitated DENV replication; ROS were also essential in driving mitochondrial apoptosis in infected Mo-DC. In addition to stimulating innate immune responses to DENV, increased ROS led to the activation of bystander Mo-DC which up-regulated maturation/activation markers and were less susceptible to viral replication. We have identified a critical role for the transcription factor Nrf2 in limiting both antiviral and cell death responses to the virus by feedback modulation of oxidative stress. Silencing of Nrf2 by RNA interference increased DENV-associated immune and apoptotic responses. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the level of oxidative stress is critical to the control of both antiviral and apoptotic programs in DENV-infected human Mo-DC and highlight the importance of redox homeostasis in the outcome of DENV infection."""

In mosquitoes, the innate immune system is highly efficient at combating foreign organisms but has the capacity to tolerate vector-borne diseases. These implications lead to replication, dissemination, and ultimately the transmission of pathogenic organisms when feeding on a host. In recent years, it has been discovered that the innate immune response of mosquitoes can trigger an enhanced immunity response to the stimulus of a previously encountered pathogen. This phenomenon, called immune priming, is characterized by a molecular response that prevents the replication of viruses, parasites, or bacteria in the body. It has been documented that immune priming can be stimulated through homologous organisms or molecules, although it has also been documented that closely related pathogens can generate an enhanced immune response to a second stimulus with a related organism. However, the cost involved in this immune response has not been characterized through the transmission of the immunological experience from parents to offspring by transgenerational immune priming (TGIP) in mosquitoes. Here, we address the impact on the rates of oviposition, hatching, development, and immune response inAedes aegyptimosquitoes, the mothers of which were stimulated with dengue virus serotypes 2 and/or 4, having found a cost of TGIP on the development time of the progeny of mothers with heterologous infections, with respect to mothers with homologous infections. Our results showed a significant effect on the sex ratio, with females being more abundant than males. We found a decrease in transcripts of the siRNA pathway in daughters of mothers who had been exposed to an immune challenge with DV. Our research demonstrates that there are costs and benefits associated with TGIP inAedes aegyptimosquitoes exposed to DV. Specifically, priming results in a lower viral load in the offspring of mothers who have previously been infected with the virus. Although some results from tests of two dengue virus serotypes show similarities, such as the percentage of pupae emergence, there are differences in the percentage of adult emergence, indicating differences in TGIP costs even within the same virus with different serotypes. This finding has crucial implications in the context of dengue virus transmission in endemic areas where multiple serotypes circulate simultaneously."""

We have recently established that vitamin D can modulate DENV-induced cytokine responses and restrict infection in human macrophages. Cytokine responses are finely regulated by several homeostatic mechanisms, including microRNAs (miRNAs) that can rapidly target specific genes involved in the control of immune signaling pathways. However, the modulation of miRNAs by vitamin D during DENV infection is still unknown. Here, using a qPCR miRNA array we profiled immune-related miRNAs induced by DENV infection in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in absence or presence of vitamin D (D3-MDM). We found several miRNAs differentially expressed in both MDM and D3-MDM upon DENV infection. Interestingly, from these, a set of 11 miRNAs were attenuated in D3-MDM as compared to MDM. Gene set enrichment analysis of the predicted mRNA targets of these attenuated miRNAs suggested a predominant role of miR-155-5p in the TLR-induced cytokine responses. Indeed, validation of miR-155-5p attenuation in D3-MDM was linked to increased expression of its target gene SOCS-1, a key component for TLR4 signaling regulation. Likewise, TLR4 activation with LPS further corroborated the same miR-155-5p/SOCS-1 negative correlation observed in D3-MDM upon DENV exposure. Moreover, D3-MDM differentiation induced down-regulation of surface TLR4 that was linked to less TLR4/NF-κB-derived secretion of IL-1β.

To this end, we conducted a nested case-control comparison of the early host transcriptional features in 24 DSS patients and 56 sex-, age-, and virus serotype-matched uncomplicated (UC) dengue patients. In the first instance, we defined the """"early dengue"""" profile. The transcriptional signature in acute rather than convalescent samples (≤72 h post-illness onset) was defined by an overabundance of interferon-inducible transcripts (31% of the 551 overabundant transcripts) and canonical gene ontology terms that included the following: response to virus, immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response. Pathway and network analyses identified STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, IRF7, IRF9, IRF1, CEBPB, and SP1 as key transcriptional factors mediating the early response. Strikingly, the only difference in the transcriptional signatures of early DSS and UC dengue cases was the greater abundance of several neutrophil-associated transcripts in patients who progressed to DSS, a finding supported by higher plasma concentrations of several canonical proteins associated with neutrophil degranulation (bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein [BPI], elastase 2 [ELA2], and defensin 1 alpha [DEF1A]). Elevated levels of neutrophil-associated transcripts were independent of the neutrophil count and also of the genotype of the infecting virus, as genome-length sequences of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) (n = 15) and DENV-2 (n = 3) sampled from DSS patients were phylogenetically indistinguishable from those sampled from uncomplicated dengue patients (32 DENV-1 and 9 DENV-2 sequences). Collectively, these data suggest a hitherto unrecognized association between neutrophil activation, pathogenesis, and the development of DSS and point to future strategies for guiding prognosis."""

During secondary infection with a heterologous dengue virus (DENV) serotype, DENV is opsonized with sub- or nonneutralizing antibodies that enhance infection of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells via the Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR), a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection. However, this enhancement of DENV infection is curious as cross-linking of activating FcγRs signals an early antiviral response by inducing the type-I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Entry through activating FcγR would thus place DENV in an intracellular environment unfavorable for enhanced replication. Here we demonstrate that, to escape this antiviral response, antibody-opsonized DENV coligates leukocyte Ig-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) to inhibit FcγR signaling for ISG expression. This immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearing receptor recruits Src homology phosphatase-1 to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). As Syk is a key intermediate of FcγR signaling, LILRB1 coligation resulted in reduced ISG expression for enhanced DENV replication. Our findings suggest a unique mechanism for DENV to evade an early antiviral response for enhanced infection."""

They were investigated and monitored for T cell subsets and a panel of clinical and laboratory parameters every day until discharged and at post-discharge from the hospital.Results:We described for the first time the kinetics of T cell response during the clinical course of DENV infection. Severe cases showed significantly lower levels of effector CD8+T cells compared to mild cases at day -1 (p= 0.017) and day 0 (p= 0.033) of defervescence. After defervescence, these cell counts in severe cases increased rapidly to equalize with the levels of mild cases. Our results also showed a decline in total CD4+T, Th1, Th1/17 cells during febrile phase of dengue patients compared to normal controls or convalescent phase. On the other hand, Th2 cells increased during DENV infection until convalescent phase. Cytokines such as interferon-γ, IL-12p70, IL-5, IL-23, IL-17A showed tendency to decrease on day 0 and 1 compared with convalescence and only IL-5 showed significance indicating the production during acute phase was not systemic.Conclusion:With a rigorous study design, we uncovered the kinetics of T cells in natural DENV infection.

Following reinfection with a dengue virus of different serotype, severe disease is linked to high levels of antibody-enhanced viral replication early in illness which is followed by a cascade of memory T-cell activation and a 'storm' of inflammatory cytokines and other chemical mediators. These compounds are released mainly from T cells, monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells, and ultimately cause an increase in vascular permeability. The consolidation of the evidence has been largely due to several important prospective sero-epidemiological studies in areas endemic for DHF/DSS, which have shown that risk of severe disease is significantly higher in secondary dengue infections. These advances have underscored the fact that DHF/DSS pathogenesis is a complex, multifactorial process involving cocirculation of various dengue virus serotypes and the interplay of host and viral factors that influence disease severity.

The models presented here incorporate time delays, antibody dependent enhancement, a dynamic switch and a correlation factor between different DENV serotypes. We find that the viral load goes down to undetectable levels within 7-14 days as is observed for dengue infection, in both cases. For primary infection, the stability analysis of steady states shows interesting dependence on the time delay involved in the production of antibodies from plasma cells. We demonstrate the existence of a critical value for the immune response parameter, beyond which the infection gets completely cured. For secondary infections with a different serotype, the homologous antibody production is enhanced due to the influence of heterologous antibodies. The antibody production is also controlled by the correlation factor, which is a measure of similarities between the different DENV serotypes involved.

Our simulation results reproducedin vitrostudies of ADE, providing a molecular basis for how sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations can enhance infection. We found that antibody fine specificity, or the relative antibody response to different epitopes on the surface of the dengue virus, plays a major role in determining the degree of ADE observed at low antibody concentrations. Specifically, we found that the higher the relative antibody response to certain cross-reactive epitopes, such as the fusion loop or prM, the greater was the range of antibody concentrations where ADE occurred, providing a basis for why low antibody concentrations are associated with severe dengue disease in secondary infections.

Viruses evolved to neutralize this response by expressing suppressor proteins. In the present study, we investigated dengue virus non structural protein 3 (dvNS3), for its RNAi-suppressor activity in human cell lines. Dengue virus (DV) NS3 reverts the GFP expression in GFP-silenced cell lines. Pull-down assays of dvNS3 revealed that it interacts with the host factor human heat shock cognate 70 (hHSC70). Down-regulation of hHSC70 resulted in accumulation of dengue viral genomic RNA. Also, the interaction of dvNS3 with hHSC70 perturbs the formation of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-loading complex (RLC), by displacing TRBP (TAR RNA-binding protein) and possibly impairing the downstream activity of miRNAs. Interestingly, some of these miRNAs have earlier been reported to be down-regulated upon DV infection in Huh7 cells. Further studies on the miRNA-mRNA relationship along with mRNA profiling of samples overexpressing dvNS3 revealed up-regulation of TAZ (tafazzin) and SYNGR1 (synaptogyrin 1), known dengue viral host factors (DVHFs). Importantly, overexpression of dvNS3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells resulted in modulation of both mature and precursor miRNAs in human cell lines. Subsequent analysis suggested that dvNS3 induced stage-specific down-regulation of miRNAs.

Here, we present a novel application of the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm to analyze the expression pattern of 12 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 28 dengue patients (13 DHF and 15 DF) during acute viral infection. The SVM model was trained using gene expression data of these genes and achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 85% with leave-one-out cross-validation. Through selective removal of gene expression data from the SVM model, we have identified seven genes (MYD88, TLR7, TLR3, MDA5, IRF3, IFN-alpha and CLEC5A) that may be central in differentiating DF patients from DHF, with MYD88 and TLR7 observed to be the most important. Though the individual removal of expression data of five other genes had no impact on the overall accuracy, a significant combined role was observed when the SVM model of the two main genes (MYD88 and TLR7) was re-trained to include the five genes, increasing the overall accuracy to approximately 96%.Conclusions/significance:Here, we present a novel use of the SVM algorithm to classify DF and DHF patients, as well as to elucidate the significance of the various genes involved.

ZIKV and DENV productively infect hPSC-derived macrophages. DENV, but not ZIKV, infection of macrophages strongly activates macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) secretion and decreases macrophage migration. Neutralization of MIF leads to improved migratory ability of DENV-infected macrophages.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for pathogen-triggered autoimmunity including molecular mimicry, cryptic antigens, epitope spreading, bystander activation and polyclonal activation. In the case of dengue virus infection which causes serious public health problems, the mechanisms regarding the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic syndrome are not fully resolved. Our previous studies suggest a mechanism of molecular mimicry in which antibodies directed against dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) cross-react with human platelets and endothelial cells and cause their damage and dysfunction, which may be related to the clinical features of dengue disease. Several cell surface proteins recognized by patient serum samples and anti-NS1 antibodies have been identified. Based on proteomic studies and sequence analysis, the C-terminal region of dengue virus NS1 shows sequence homology with target proteins. In addition, different regions of dengue virus proteins including core, prM, E and NS1 proteins show sequence homology with different coagulatory molecules. As an example, the amino acid sequence 101-106 of E protein (WGNGCG) shows sequence homology with factors XI, X, IX, VII, II (thrombin), plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator. Furthermore, single chain variable region against NS1 can interfere with fibrin formation, which leads to prolonged thrombin time. We hypothesize that molecular mimicry between dengue virus proteins and coagulatory molecules may induce cross-reactive autoantibodies that can interfere with coagulation activation. A molecular mimicry pathogenesis for dengue disease which involves cross-reactivity of dengue virus with human endothelial cells, platelets and coagulatory molecules is proposed."""

The three viruses differentially regulate components of Toll, Immune deficiency (IMD) and c-Jun N- terminal Kinase (JNK) pathways. However, silencing of the Toll and IMD pathway components showed variable effects on SG infection by each virus. In contrast, regulation of the JNK pathway produced consistent responses in both SGs and midgut. Infection by the three viruses increased with depletion of the activator Kayak and decreased with depletion of the negative regulator Puckered. Virus-induced JNK pathway regulates the complement factor, Thioester containing protein-20 (TEP20), and the apoptosis activator, Dronc, in SGs. Individual and co-silencing of these genes demonstrate their antiviral effects and that both may function together. Co-silencing either TEP20 or Dronc with Puckered annihilates JNK pathway antiviral effect. Upon infection in SGs, TEP20 induces antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), while Dronc is required for apoptosis independently of TEP20.

DENV is a member of the Flaviviridae family and has 4 distinct serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). No lasting cross protection is afforded to heterologous serotypes following infection by any one of the individual serotypes. The presence of nonneutralizing antibodies to one serotype can facilitate the occurrence of more-severe dengue hemorrhagic fever through immune enhancement upon infection with a second serotype. For this reason, the development of a safe, tetravalent vaccine to produce a balanced immune response to all four serotypes is critical. We have developed a novel approach to produce safe and effective live-attenuated vaccines for DENV and other insect-borne viruses. Host range (HR) mutants of each DENV serotype were created by truncating transmembrane domain 1 of the E protein and selecting for strains of DENV that replicated well in insect cells but not mammalian cells. These vaccine strains were tested for immunogenicity in African green monkeys (AGMs). No vaccine-related adverse events occurred. The vaccine strains were confirmed to be attenuated in vivo by infectious center assay (ICA). Analysis by 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) established that by day 62 postvaccination, 100% of animals seroconverted to DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4. Additionally, the DENV HR tetravalent vaccine (HR-Tet) showed a tetravalent anamnestic immune response in 100% (16/16) of AGMs after challenge with wild-type (WT) DENV strains.Importance:We have generated a live attenuated viral (LAV) vaccine capable of eliciting a strong immune response in African green monkeys (AGMs) in a single dose. This vaccine is delivered by injecting one of four attenuated serotypes into each limb of the animal. 100% of animals given the vaccine generated antibodies against all 4 serotypes, and this response was found to be balanced in nature.

Based on studies of mouse anti-E monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), GR MAbs were nonneutralizing or weakly neutralizing compared with type-specific MAbs; a GR response was thus not regarded as important for vaccine strategy. We investigated the epitopes, binding avidities, and neutralization potencies of 32 human GR anti-E MAbs. In addition to fusion loop (FL) residues in E protein domain II, human GR MAbs recognized an epitope involving both FL and bc loop residues in domain II. The neutralization potencies and binding avidities of GR MAbs derived from secondary DENV infection were stronger than those derived from primary infection. GR MAbs derived from primary DENV infection primarily blocked attachment, whereas those derived from secondary infection blocked DENV postattachment. Analysis of the repertoire of anti-E MAbs derived from patients with primary DENV infection revealed that the majority were GR, low-avidity, and weakly neutralizing MAbs, whereas those from secondary infection were primarily GR, high-avidity, and potently neutralizing MAbs. Our findings suggest that the weakly neutralizing GR anti-E Abs generated from primary DENV infection become potently neutralizing MAbs against the four serotypes after secondary infection.

We present data on multiple virus and antibody titres measurements recorded sequentially during infection from 53 Vietnamese dengue patients. We fit mechanistic mathematical models of the dynamics of viral replication and the host immune response to these data. These models fit the data well. The model with antibody removing virus fits the data best, but with a role suggested for ADCC or other infected cell clearance mechanisms. Our analysis therefore shows that the observed viral and antibody kinetics are consistent with antibody playing a key role in controlling viral replication. This work gives quantitative insight into the relationship between antibody levels and the efficiency of viral clearance. It will inform the future development of mechanistic models of how vaccines and antivirals might modify the course of natural dengue infection."""

The type I interferon (IFN) system has evolved in vertebrates to generate tissue responses that actively block replication of multiple known and potentially zoonotic viruses. As such, its control and activation through pharmacological agents may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for simultaneously impairing growth of multiple virus types and rendering host populations resistant to virus spread. In light of this strategy's potential, we undertook a screen to identify novel interferon-activating small molecules. Here, we describe 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-(5-isopropyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-1,2-dihydrochromeno[2,3-c]pyrrole-3,9-dione, which we termed AV-C. Treatment of human cells with AV-C activates innate and interferon-associated responses that strongly inhibit replication of Zika, Chikungunya, and dengue viruses. By utilizing genome editing, we investigated the host proteins essential to AV-C-induced cellular states. This showed that the compound requires a TRIF-dependent signaling cascade that culminates in IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent expression and secretion of type I interferon to elicit antiviral responses. The other canonical IRF3-terminal adaptor proteins STING and IPS-1/MAVS were dispensable for AV-C-induced phenotypes. However, our work revealed an important inhibitory role for IPS-1/MAVS, but not TRIF, in flavivirus replication, implying that TRIF-directed viral evasion may not occur. Additionally, we show that in response to AV-C, primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines that are linked with establishment of adaptive immunity to viral pathogens. Ultimately, synthetic innate immune activators such as AV-C may serve multiple therapeutic purposes, including direct antimicrobial responses and facilitation of pathogen-directed adaptive immunity.IMPORTANCEThe type I interferon system is part of the innate immune response that has evolved in vertebrates as a first line of broad-spectrum immunological defense against an unknowable diversity of microbial, especially viral, pathogens. Here, we characterize a novel small molecule that artificially activates this response and in so doing generates a cellular state antagonistic to growth of currently emerging viruses: Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue virus. We also show that this molecule is capable of eliciting cellular responses that are predictive of establishment of adaptive immunity. As such, this agent may represent a powerful and multipronged therapeutic tool to combat emerging and other viral diseases."""

However, some pathogens, including several RNA viruses, subvert the autophagy pathway, or components of the pathway, to facilitate their replication. In the present study, the effect of inhibiting autophagy on the growth of dengue virus was tested using a novel inhibitor, spautin-1 (specific and potent autophagy inhibitor 1). Inhibition of autophagy by spautin-1 generated heat-sensitive, noninfectious dengue virus particles, revealing a large effect of components of the autophagy pathway on viral maturation. A smaller effect on viral RNA accumulation was also observed. Conversely, stimulation of autophagy resulted in increased viral titers and pathogenicity in the mouse. We conclude that the presence of functional autophagy components facilitates viral RNA replication and, more importantly, is required for infectious dengue virus production. Pharmacological inhibition of host processes is an attractive antiviral strategy to avoid selection of treatment-resistant variants, and inhibitors of autophagy may prove to be valuable therapeutics against dengue virus infection and pathogenesis."""

Here, we report that the DENV NS2B protease cofactor targets the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) for lysosomal degradation to avoid the detection of mitochondrial DNA during infection.

IRAV is an RNA binding protein and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) in uninfected cells, where it interacts with the MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase, suggesting a role for IRAV in the processing of viral RNA. After DENV infection, IRAV, along with MOV10 and Xrn1, localizes to the DENV replication complex and associates with DENV proteins. Depletion of IRAV or MOV10 results in an increase in viral RNA.

A better understanding of the interferon-mediated antiviral response to dengue virus may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we examine the influence of the interferon-stimulated geneIRAV(FLJ11286) on dengue virus replication. We show that IRAV associates with P bodies in uninfected cells and with the dengue virus replication complex after infection.

Antibodies against DENVs are responsible for both protection as well as pathogenesis. A vaccine that is safe for and efficacious in all people irrespective of their age and domicile is still an unmet need. It is becoming increasingly apparent that vaccine design must eliminate epitopes implicated in the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies.Methodology/principal findings:We report a Pichia pastoris-expressed dengue immunogen, DSV4, based on DENV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), which contains well-characterized serotype-specific and cross-reactive epitopes. In natural infection, <10% of the total neutralizing antibody response is EDIII-directed. Yet, this is a functionally relevant domain which interacts with the host cell surface receptor. DSV4 was designed by in-frame fusion of EDIII of all four DENV serotypes and hepatitis B surface (S) antigen and co-expressed with unfused S antigen to form mosaic virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs displayed EDIIIs of all four DENV serotypes based on probing with a battery of serotype-specific anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies. The DSV4 VLPs were highly immunogenic, inducing potent and durable neutralizing antibodies against all four DENV serotypes encompassing multiple genotypes, in mice and macaques. DSV4-induced murine antibodies suppressed viremia in AG129 mice and conferred protection against lethal DENV-4 virus challenge. Further, neither murine nor macaque anti-DSV4 antibodies promoted mortality or inflammatory cytokine production when passively transferred and tested in an in vivo dengue disease enhancement model of AG129 mice.Conclusions/significance:Directing the immune response to a non-immunodominant but functionally relevant serotype-specific dengue epitope of the four DENV serotypes, displayed on a VLP platform, can help minimize the risk of inducing disease-enhancing antibodies while eliciting effective tetravalent seroconversion.

Two recent in vivo studies demonstrated that sfRNA enhances mosquito transmission, resulting in increased infection rate of saliva. Transmission efficiency is determined by the immune response.

The development of intervention strategies had long been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. DENV does not replicate in wild-type mice due to its inability to antagonise the mouse type I interferon (IFN) response. Mice deficient in type I IFN signalling (Ifnar1-/-mice) are highly susceptible to DENV infection, but their immunocompromised status makes it difficult to interpret immune responses elicited by experimental vaccines. To develop an alternative mouse model for vaccine testing, we treated adult wild-type mice with MAR1-5A3-an IFNAR1-blocking, non-cell-depleting antibody-prior to infection with the DENV2 strain D2Y98P. This approach would allow for vaccination of immunocompetent mice and subsequent inhibition of type I IFN signalling prior to challenge infection. WhileIfnar1-/-mice quickly succumbed to infection, MAR1-5A3-treated mice did not show any signs of illness but eventually seroconverted. Infectious virus was recovered from the sera and visceral organs ofIfnar1-/-mice, but not from those of mice treated with MAR1-5A3. However, high levels of viral RNA were detected in the samples of MAR1-5A3-treated mice, indicating productive viral replication and dissemination.

We propose that young age and previous infections could be simple factors that affect this response. Here, we evaluated the primary and secondary responses of circulating ASC in infants (6-12 months old) and children (1-14 years old) infected with dengue showing different degrees of clinical severity. The ASC response was delayed and of lower magnitude in infants, compared with older children. In primary infection (PI), the total and envelope (E) protein-specific IgM ASC were dominant in infants but not in children, and a negative correlation was found between age and the number of IgM ASC (rho = -0.59, P = 0.03). However, infants with plasma dengue-specific IgG detectable in the acute phase developed an intense ASC response largely dominated by IgG and comparable to that of children with secondary infection (SI). IgM and IgG produced by ASC circulating in PI or SI were highly cross-reactive among the four serotypes. Dengue infection caused the disturbance of B cell subsets, particularly a decrease in the relative frequency of naïve B cells. Higher frequencies of total and E protein-specific IgM ASC in the infants and IgG in the children were associated with clinically severe forms of infection. Therefore, the ASC response induced by dengue is highly influenced by the age at which infection occurs and previous immune status, and its magnitude is a relevant element in the clinical outcome. These results are important in the search for correlates of protection and for determining the ideal age for vaccinating against dengue."""

There are four serotypes (DENV-1 to 4), which can cause a clinical spectrum varying from a mild disease; dengue fever, to a potential life-threatening form; dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The molecular mechanism to explain the developing of DHF remains uncertainly, but it has been related to previous immunity to a different serotype, host-depending factors (age, nutritional status, HLA type) and to viral genotypes. In this sense, have been described a number of genotypes among the serotypes, some of which has been associated with increased severity. In Venezuela, since 1989 have been reported cases due to all the viral serotypes, but there are few studies attempting to determine the genotype circulating in both epidemic and endemic situations. In all the reports, Venezuelan isolates are related to Asian genotypes, some of which have been associated with high risk to develop DHF. It is necessary more studies to analyze the whole viral genome from isolates collected in last years, in order to get information about how and why occur the viral extinction process in epidemics settings, its geographical origin and if certainly there are genotypes associated with DHF circulating in the country.

Since DENV is a human pathogen, we sought to ascertain whether a similar phenomenon could occur in humans by characterizing the products released by human MCs (huMCs) upon direct (antibody-independent) DENV exposure, using the phenotypically mature huMC line, ROSA. DENV did not productively infect huMCs but prompted huMC release of proteases and eicosanoids and induced a Th1-polarized transcriptional profile. In co-culture and trans-well systems, huMC products activated human microvascular endothelial cells, involving transcription of vasoactive mediators and increased monolayer permeability. This permeability was blocked by MC-stabilizing drugs, or limited by drugs targeting certain MC products. Thus, MC stabilizers are a viable strategy to limit MC-promoted vascular leakage during DENV infection in humans."""

A recent application of the microarray to dengue virus type 1 (DV1) infected lung carcinoma cells revealed the increased expression of both extracellular and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors; retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (MDA-5) and Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3).

Cross-reactive antibodies to an earlier dengue virus infection are a recognized risk factor for severe disease. These antibodies bind heterologous dengue serotypes and enhance infection into Fc-receptor-bearing cells, a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. One crucial cytokine seen elevated in severe dengue patients is IL-1β, a potent inflammatory cytokine matured by the inflammasome. We used a highly-physiologic system by studying antibody-dependent enhancement of IL-1β in primary human monocytes with anti-dengue human monoclonal antibodies isolated from patients. Antibody-enhancement increased viral replication in primary human monocytes inoculated with supernatant harvested from Vero cells infected with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) 16681. Surprisingly, IL-1β secretion induced by infectious supernatant harvested from two independent Vero cell lines was not enhanced by antibody. Secretion of multiple other inflammatory cytokines was also independent of antibody signaling. However, IL-1β secretion did require NLRP3 and caspase-1 activity. Immunodepletion of dengue virions from the infectious supernatant confirmed that virus was not the main IL-1β-inducing agent, suggesting that a supernatant component(s) not associated with the virion induced IL-1β production. We excluded RNA, DNA, contaminating LPS, viral NS1 protein, complement, and cytokines. In contrast, purified Vero-derived DENV-2 16681 exhibited antibody-enhancement of both infection and IL-1β induction. Furthermore, C6/36 mosquito cells did not produce such an inflammatory component, as crude supernatant harvested from insect cells infected with DENV-2 16681 induced antibody-dependent IL-1β secretion. This study indicates that Vero cells infected with DENV-2 16681 may produce inflammatory components during dengue virus propagation that mask the virus-specific immune response.

We examined the various stages in the DENV infection process to better understand the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking (WMVB). Our results suggest that infection with Wolbachia does not inhibit DENV binding or cell entry, but reduces virus replication. In contrast to a previous report, we also observed a similar reduction in replication of West Nile virus (WNV). This reduced replication is associated with rapid viral RNA degradation in the cytoplasm. We didn't find a role for host miRNAs in WMVB. Further analysis showed that the 3' end of the virus subgenomic RNA was protected and accumulated over time suggesting that the degradation is XRN1-mediated. We also found that sub genomic flavivirus RNA accumulation inactivated XRN1 in mosquito cells in the absence of Wolbachia and led to enhancement of RNA degradation in its presence. Depletion of XRN1 decreased WMVB which was associated with a significant increase in DENV RNA. We also observed that WMVB is influenced by virus MOI and rate of virus replication. A comparatively elevated blocking was observed for slowly replicating DENV, compared to WNV. Similar results were obtained while analysing different DENV serotypes."""

These antibodies, though initially protective, decline during the first year of life to levels thought to be disease enhancing, before reaching undetectable levels. Infants have long been studied to understand the interaction between infection and disease on an individual level.Methods/findings:Considering infants (cases <1 year old) as a unique group, we analyzed serotype specific dengue case data from patients admitted to a pediatric hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. We show differences in the propensity of serotypes to cause disease in individuals with dengue antibodies (infants and post-primary cases) and in individuals without dengue antibodies (primary cases). The mean age of infant cases differed among serotypes, consistent with previously observed differential waning of maternal antibody titers by serotype. We show that trends over time in epidemiology of infant cases are consistent with those observed in the whole population, and therefore with trends in the force of infection.Conclusions/significance:Infants with dengue are informative about the interaction between antibody and the dengue serotypes, confirming that in this population DENV-2 and DENV-4 almost exclusively cause disease in the presence of dengue antibody despite infections occurring in others. We also observe differences between the serotypes in the mean age in infant cases, informative about the interaction between waning immunity and disease for the different serotypes in infants. In addition, we show that the mean age of infant cases over time is informative about transmission in the whole population.

The activation of interferon pathways by DENV protected bystander cells from infection and protected the infected cells from massive apoptosis. Furthermore, DENV infection activated the NF-κB pathway, which led to production of proinflammatory cytokines and downregulated many liver-specific genes such as albumin and coagulation factor V.

DENV capsid protein (DENV C) physically interacts with the human death domain-associated protein Daxx. A double substitution mutation in DENV C (R85A/K86A) abrogates Daxx interaction, nuclear localization and apoptosis. Therefore we compared the expression of cell death genes between HepG2 cells expressing DENV C and DENV C (R85A/K86A) using a real-time PCR array. Expression of CD137, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, increased significantly in HepG2 cells expressing DENV C compared to HepG2 cells expressing DENV C (R85A/K86A). In addition, CD137-mediated apoptotic activity in HepG2 cells expressing DENV C was significantly increased by anti-CD137 antibody compared to that of HepG2 cells expressing DENV C (R85A/K86A). In DENV-infected HepG2 cells, CD137 mRNA and CD137 positive cells significantly increased and CD137-mediated apoptotic activity was increased by anti-CD137 antibody.

Here, we found that the TC genotype and T-carriers for SNP rs1285933 in the C-type lectin superfamily member 5 (CLEC5A) gene was associated with severe dengue in a Northern Brazilian population (OR=2.75 and p-value=0.01, OR=2.11 and p-value=0.04, respectively). We also tested the functional effect of the CLEC5A protein and found that it is upregulated on the surface of human monocytes after in vitro dengue infection. CLEC5A was correlated with viral load inside the monocytes (Spearman r=0.55, p=0.008) and TNF production in culture supernatants (Spearman r=0.72, p=0.03). Analysis of mRNA in blood samples from DENV4-infected patients exhibiting mild symptoms showed that CLEC5A mRNA expression is correlated with TNF (r=0.67, p=0.0001) and other immune mediators. Monocytes from rs1285933 TT/TC individuals showed lower CLEC5A expression compared to CC genotypes. However, in these cells, CLEC5A was not correlated with TNF production. In summary, we confirmed that CLEC5A is genetically associated with dengue severity outcome, playing a central role during the immune response triggered by a dengue viral infection, and rs1285933 is a relevant SNP that is able to regulate signaling pathways after interactions between the dengue virus and CLEC5A receptors."""

In this study, serum samples from DF patients, healthy subjects, and patients with falciparum malaria (an infectious disease control) were investigated by 2D-DIGE in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The findings were validated with Western blotting. Functional clustering of the identified proteins was performed using PANTHER and DAVID tools. Compared to the healthy controls, we found significant changes in the expression levels of 48 protein spots corresponding to 18 unique proteins (7 downregulated and 11 upregulated) in DF patients (p<0.05). Among these differentially-expressed proteins, 11 candidates exhibited different trends in dengue fever compared to falciparum malaria.

This model arose from our study of the population dynamics of dengue fever. The dengue virus presents four serotypes each induces host immunity but only certain degree of cross-immunity to heterologous serotypes. Our model has been constructed to study both the epidemiological trends of the disease and conditions that permit coexistence in competing strains. Dengue is in the Americas an epidemic disease and our model reproduces this kind of dynamics. We consider two viral strains and temporary cross-immunity. Our analysis shows the existence of an unstable endemic state ('saddle' point) that produces a long transient behavior where both dengue serotypes cocirculate. Conditions for asymptotic stability of equilibria are discussed supported by numerical simulations. We argue that the existence of competitive exclusion in this system is product of the interplay between the host superinfection process and frequency-dependent (vector to host) contact rates.

With an estimated 390 million infected people per year dengue virus (DENV) currently causes the most prevalent arboviral disease. During the last decade chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused large outbreaks and has expanded its territory causing millions of cases in Asia, Africa and America. The viruses share a common mosquito vector and during the acute phase cause similar flu-like symptoms that can proceed to more severe or debilitating symptoms. The growing overlap in the geographical distribution of these mosquito-borne infections has led to an upsurge in reported cases of DENV/CHIKV co-infections. Unfortunately, at present we have little understanding of consequences of the co-infections to the human host. The overall aim of this study was to define viral replication dynamics and the innate immune signature involved in concurrent DENV and CHIKV infections in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We demonstrate that concomitant infection resulted in a significant reduction of CHIKV progeny and moderate enhancement of DENV production. Remarkably, the inhibitory effect of DENV on CHIKV infection occurred independently of DENV replication. Furthermore, changes in type I IFN, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, MCP-1 and IP-10 production were observed during concomitant infections. Notably, co-infections led to a significant increase in the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, cytokines that are widely considered to play a crucial role in the early pathogenesis of both viral diseases.

We observed a marked decrease in susceptibility to dengue virus infection when mosquitoes harbored certain field-derived bacterial isolates in their midgut. Transcript abundance analysis of selected antimicrobial peptide genes suggested that the mosquito's microbiota elicits a basal immune activity that appears to act against dengue virus infection.

The real-time PCR data showed that Notch ligand Dll1 was significantly induced in DENV-infected monocytes; and receptor Notch4, ligands Dll1 and Dll4, and target Hes1 were dramatically enhanced in DENV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells. In macrophages, induction of Dll1 and Dll4 mediated by DENV2 was increased by treatment with interferon-β (IFN-β), and was impaired by neutralization of IFN-β.

To this end, we selected a ZIKV-specific mAb (ZV54) and generated three ZV54 variants using Chinese hamster ovary cells and wild-type (WT) and glycoengineered ΔXFNicotiana benthamianaplants as production hosts (ZV54CHO, ZV54WT, and ZV54ΔXF). The three ZV54 variants shared an identical polypeptide backbone, but each exhibited a distinct Fc N-glycosylation profile. All three ZV54 variants showed similar neutralization potency against ZIKV but no ADE activity for DENV infection, validating the importance of selecting the virus/serotype-specific mAbs for avoiding ADE by related flaviviruses. For ZIKV infection, however, ZV54CHOand ZV54ΔXFshowed significant ADE activity while ZV54WTcompletely forwent ADE, suggesting that Fc glycan modulation may yield mAb glycoforms that abrogate ADE even for homologous viruses. In contrast to the current strategies for Fc mutations that abrogate all effector functions along with ADE, our approach allowed the preservation of effector functions as all ZV54 glycovariants retained antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the ZIKV-infected cells. Furthermore, the ADE-free ZV54WTdemonstrated in vivo efficacy in a ZIKV-infection mouse model. Collectively, our study provides further support for the hypothesis that antibody-viral surface antigen and Fc-mediated host cell interactions are both prerequisites for ADE, and that a dual-approach strategy, as shown herein, contributes to the development of highly safe and efficacious anti-ZIKV mAb therapeutics.

However, given the lack of suitable animal models for DENV infection, the mechanism of ADE and its contribution to pathology remain elusive.

We have shown that DENV infection of salivary glands strongly up-regulates the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in the vector's innate immune response, including the immune deficiency (IMD) and Toll signalling pathways, and that it induces the expression of the gene encoding a putative anti-bacterial, cecropin-like, peptide (AAEL000598). Both the chemically synthesized non-cleaved, signal peptide-containing gene product of AAEL000598, and the cleaved, mature form, were found to exert, in addition to antibacterial activity, anti-DENV and anti-Chikungunya viral activity. However, in contrast to the mature form, the immature cecropin peptide was far more effective against Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and, furthermore, had strong anti-parasite activity as shown by its ability to kill Leishmania spp. Results from circular dichroism analysis showed that the immature form more readily adopts a helical conformation which would help it to cause membrane permeabilization, thus permitting its transfer across hydrophobic cell surfaces, which may explain the difference in the anti-pathogenic activity between the two forms. The present study underscores not only the importance of DENV-induced cecropin in the innate immune response of Ae. aegypti, but also emphasizes the broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic activity of the immature, signal peptide-containing form of this peptide."""

In this study, we obtained five DENV1 isolates (DENV1 A to E) from the outbreak of dengue fever in 2014 of Guangzhou, China, and analyzed their replication efficiency and virulence in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that among the five DENV1 strains, DENV1 B has the highest replication efficiency in both human and mosquito cells in vitro, also causes the highest mortality to suckling mice. Further study suggested that nonstructural proteins from DENV1B have higher capacity to suppress host interferon signaling. In addition, the NS2B3 protease from DENV1B has higher enzymatic activity compared with that from DENV1 E. Finally, we identified that the 64th amino acid of NS2A and the 55th amino acid of NS2B were two virulence determining sites for DENV1.

This outbreak was associated with the reemergence of dengue virus-2 (DENV-2), with the responsible strain identified as a variant of the previously circulating DENV-2 cosmopolitan genotype. In this study, we characterized the DENV-2 cosmopolitan genotype from patients during this epidemic. Also, we identified host factors that contributed to the severity of dengue infection in patients infected with this particular virus. Ninety-one acute serum samples from patients at the National Hospital in Kandy were randomly selected. Of these, 40.2% and 48.9% were positive for dengue IgM and IgG, respectively. NS1 antigen levels were significantly higher in primary infections. The severe dengue (SD) and dengue with warning signs (DWWS) groups exhibited significantly higher viral genome and infectivity titers than the dengue without warning signs (DWoWS) group. The highest viremia level was observed in SD patients. As for host cytokine response, interferon α (IFN-α) levels were significantly higher in the DWoWS group than in the DWWS and SD groups, whereas interleukin (IL)-12p40 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels in SD patients were significantly higher than in the other two groups. The TNF-α, IL-4, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 concentrations were positively correlated with NS1 antigen levels. From whole-genome analysis, NS4 had the highest frequency of amino acid variants, followed by the E gene. Our study suggests that viremia levels and immune responses contributed to SD outcomes, and these findings may help in identifying an effective therapeutic strategy against SD infection."""

The severe, potentially lethal forms of DENV disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) are associated with the production of high level of cytokines, elicited as part of the host antiviral response, although the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We previously showed that infection by DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) disrupts promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene product nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) after viral protein translation in infected cells. Apart from playing a key role as the nucleating agent in forming PML-NBs, PML has antiviral activity against various viruses, including DENV. The present study builds on this work, showing for the first time that all four DENV serotypes elicit PML-NB breakdown. Importantly, we show for the first time that of the nuclear localizing proteins of DENV, DENV non-structural protein (NS) 5 polymerase alone is sufficient to elicit PML-NB disassembly, in part through complexing with PML isoforms III and IV, but not other PML isoforms or other PML-NB components. The results raise the possibility that PML-NB disruption by nuclear localized NS5 contributes to DENV's suppression of the host antiviral response."""

The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells.Methodology/principal findings:We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3-6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. By performing a meta-analysis of our dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets, we confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, whereas in vitro infection leads to an increased interferon signature, this was not consistently observed from in vivo patient samples, suggesting that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3-6 of illness.Conclusions/significance:These data highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection as well as identify some commonalities. Compilation of larger datasets in the future across multiple studies, as we have initiated in this report, may well lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach."""

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate various biological processes. Knowledge on Ae. albopictus lncRNAs and their functional role in virus-host interactions are still limited. Here, we identified and characterized the lncRNAs in the genome of an arbovirus vector, Ae. albopictus, and evaluated their potential involvement in DENV and ZIKV infection. We used 148 public datasets, and identified a total of 10, 867 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 5,809, 4,139, and 919 were intergenic, intronic and antisense respectively. The Ae. albopictus lncRNAs shared many characteristics with other species such as short length, low GC content, and low sequence conservation. RNA-sequencing of Ae. albopictus cells infected with DENV and ZIKV showed that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon virus infection. Target prediction analysis revealed that Ae. albopictus lncRNAs may regulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and other metabolic and cellular processes. To verify the role of lncRNAs in virus infection, we generated mutations in lncRNA loci using CRISPR-Cas9, and discovered that two lncRNA loci mutations, namely XLOC_029733 (novel lncRNA transcript id: lncRNA_27639.2) and LOC115270134 (known lncRNA transcript id: XR_003899061.1) resulted in enhancement of DENV and ZIKV replication.

We previously demonstrated a protective role for CD8(+) T cells during primary DENV infection using a mouse-passaged DENV strain and IFN-α/βR(-/-) C57BL/6 mice, which are susceptible to DENV infection. In this study, we examine the role of CD4(+) T cells during primary DENV infection. Four I-A(b)-restricted epitopes derived from three of the nonstructural DENV proteins were identified. CD4(+) T cells expanded and were activated after DENV infection, with peak activation occurring on day 7. The DENV-specific CD4(+) T cells expressed intracellular IFN-γ, TNF, IL-2, and CD40L, and killed peptide-pulsed target cells in vivo. Surprisingly, depletion of CD4(+) T cells before DENV infection had no effect on viral loads. Consistent with this observation, CD4(+) T cell depletion did not affect the DENV-specific IgG or IgM Ab titers or their neutralizing activity, or the DENV-specific CD8(+) T cell response. However, immunization with the CD4(+) T cell epitopes before infection resulted in significantly lower viral loads. Thus, we conclude that whereas CD4(+) T cells are not required for controlling primary DENV infection, their induction by immunization can contribute to viral clearance. These findings suggest inducing anti-DENV CD4(+) T cell responses by vaccination may be beneficial."""

When introduced to nonnative mosquito hosts, Wolbachia induce resistance to a number of human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), Plasmodium, and filarial nematodes, but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, we have deciphered how Wolbachia infection affects the Aedes aegypti host in inducing resistance to DENV. The microarray assay indicates that transcripts of genes with functions related to immunity and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions are up-regulated in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia. Infection with this bacterium leads to induction of oxidative stress and an increased level of reactive oxygen species in its mosquito host. Reactive oxygen species elevation is linked to the activation of the Toll pathway, which is essential in mediating the expression of antioxidants to counterbalance oxidative stress. This immune pathway also is responsible for activation of antimicrobial peptides-defensins and cecropins. We provide evidence that these antimicrobial peptides are involved in inhibition of DENV proliferation in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Utilization of transgenic Ae. aegypti and the RNAi depletion approach has been instrumental in proving the role of defensins and cecropins in the resistance of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti to DENV. These results indicate that a symbiotic bacterium can manipulate the host defense system to facilitate its own persistent infection, resulting in a compromise of the mosquito's ability to host human pathogens.

Each year, flaviviruses cause more than 100 million infections worldwide, some of which lead to life-threatening conditions such as encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever. Among the viral proteins, NS3 and NS5 proteins constitute the major enzymatic components of the viral replication complex and are essential to the flavivirus life cycle.Results:We report here the results of a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the interactions between human host proteins and the flavivirus NS3 and NS5 proteins. Using our screen results and literature curation, we performed a global analysis of the NS3 and NS5 cellular targets based on functional annotation with the Gene Ontology features. We finally created the first flavivirus NS3 and NS5 proteins interaction network and analysed the topological features of this network. Our proteome mapping screen identified 108 human proteins interacting with NS3 or NS5 proteins or both. The global analysis of the cellular targets revealed the enrichment of host proteins involved in RNA binding, transcription regulation, vesicular transport or innate immune response regulation.Conclusions:We proposed that the selective disruption of these newly identified host/virus interactions could represent a novel and attractive therapeutic strategy in treating flavivirus infections.

High viral loads correlate with disease severity, and both type I & II interferons (IFNs) are crucial for controlling viral replication. We have previously reported that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1-deficient mice are resistant to DENV-induced disease, but little is known about this STAT1-independent mechanism of protection. To determine the molecular basis of the STAT1-independent pathway, mice lacking STAT1, STAT2, or both STAT1 and STAT2 were infected with a virulent mouse-adapted strain of DENV2. In the first 72 hours of infection, the single-deficient mice lacking STAT1 or STAT2 possessed 50-100 fold higher levels of viral RNA than wild type mice in the serum, spleen, and other visceral tissues, but remained resistant to DENV-induced death. In contrast, the double-deficient mice exhibited the early death phenotype previously observed in type I and II IFN receptor knockout mice (AG129), indicating that STAT2 is the mediator of the STAT1-independent host defense mechanism. Further studies demonstrated that this STAT2-dependent STAT1-independent mechanism requires the type I IFN receptor, and contributes to the autocrine amplification of type I IFN expression. Examination of gene expression in the spleen and bone marrow-derived macrophages following DENV infection revealed STAT2-dependent pathways can induce the transcription of a subset of interferon stimulated genes even in the absence of STAT1. Collectively, these results help elucidate the nature of the poorly understood STAT1-independent host defense mechanism against viruses by identifying a functional type I IFN/STAT2 signaling pathway following DENV infection in vivo."""

Here, in this study the involvement of RIG-I and MDA5 in DENV-induced IFN-β response A549 cells were investigated. DENV infection readily up-regulated RIG-I expression, activated IRF-3 and RIG-I mRNA transcription, and induced the production of IFN-β in A549 cells in a strain- and serotype-independent manner. While gene silencing of RIG-I by small interfering RNAs failed to significantly inhibit IFN-β production induced by DENV infection. Further experiments demonstrated that MDA5 was also induced by DENV infection, and MDA5 knockout did not block DENV induced IFN-β production in A549 cells.

A study was performed to compare the cellular immune status in DHF, DF and non-dengue viral infections (NDF) in order to determine the value of these parameters in distinguishing DHF from classic DF and other viral infections during the acute febrile stage of the disease. This study involved 109 febrile patients admitted because of suspected DHF. Fifty patients were serologically confirmed cases of dengue infection, of which 25 had grade 1 or 2 DHF. There was a reduction in total T (CD3), CD4 and CD8 cells in DHF and demonstrated that a low level of CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD5 cells discriminated DHF from DF patients during the febrile stage of the illness. In contrast, B (CD19) cells and natural killer (NK) cells did not appear to be discriminatory in this study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that a combination of CD3 cell of < or = 45% and CD5 cell of < or = 55% was the best marker to identify DHF patients (sensitivity = 84% and specificity = 52% for CD3 cell of < or = 45%; sensitivity = 92% and specificity = 71% for CD5 cell of < or = 55%). CD4 cell of < or = 25% and CD8 cell < or = 30% were equally good in discriminating DHF from DF patients.

The reduction in CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5 cells correlated with the degree of thrombocytopenia in DHF (p < 0.05) which suggests that these cells probably participate in a common pathogenetic mechanism."""

Infection with any of the four viruses confers life-long homotypic, but not heterotypic, immunity. Dengue viruses can be transmitted by several mosquito species of the genus Aedes, but by far the most common vector is Aedes aegypti. All non-human primates that have been tested are susceptible to infection, but none exhibit signs of illness. The resulting lack of a suitable experimental host other than man has slowed progress in understanding the pathogenesis of severe forms of the disease.

For this reason, a tetravalent vaccine may likely be needed. Candidate vaccines against the four serotypes have been tested in volunteers and have proven to be immunogenic and safe. Although attenuated live virus vaccines are promising, more study is needed regarding their effectiveness and safety.

Mosquito saliva contains potent immunogens capable of inducing antibody production directly related to mosquito bite exposure intensity and disease risk. In this study, we first determined the DENV infection status by two different DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) based rapid tests and qRT-PCR, then measured the levels of IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies against salivary proteins of Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes in volunteers living in a dengue endemic area. Our results show that people with a positive DENV diagnosis present higher levels of IgG4 antibodies than people with a negative diagnostic test, and that these antibody levels were higher in people with secondary DENV infections. With this study, we show that detection of IgG4 antibodies against mosquito saliva may be a reliable method to evaluate the risk of dengue infection."""

It has been suggested that a balance may be involved between protective and pathologic immune responses. This study aimed to define differential immune responses in association with clinical outcomes by gene expression profiling of a selected panel of inflammatory genes in whole blood samples from children with severe dengue infections.Methodology/principal findings:Whole blood mRNA from 56 Indonesian children with severe dengue virus infections was analyzed during early admission and at day -1, 0, 1, and 5-8 after defervescence. Levels were related to baseline levels collected at a 1-month follow-up visit. Processing of mRNA was performed in a single reaction by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, measuring mRNA levels from genes encoding 36 inflammatory proteins and 14 Toll-like receptor (TLR)-associated molecules. The inflammatory gene profiles showed up-regulation during infection of eight genes, including IFNG and IL12A, which indicated an antiviral response. On the contrary, genes associated with the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway were down-regulated, including NFKB1, NFKB2, TNFR1, IL1B, IL8, and TNFA. Many of these NF-kappaB pathway-related genes, but not IFNG or IL12A, correlated with adverse clinical events such as development of pleural effusion and hemorrhagic manifestations. The TLR profile showed that TLRs were differentially activated during severe dengue infections: increased expression of TLR7 and TLR4R3 was found together with a decreased expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4R4, and TLR4 co-factor CD14.Conclusions/significance:These data show that different immunological pathways are differently expressed and associated with different clinical outcomes in children with severe dengue infections."""

Here, we generated a panel ofAe. aegypti-derived cell lines infected with antiviral strainswMel andwAlbB or the non-antiviralWolbachiastrainwPip to understand host cell morphological changes specifically induced by antiviral strains. Antiviral strains were frequently found to be entirely wrapped by the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, whilewPip bacteria clustered separately in the host cell cytoplasm. ER-derived lipid droplets (LDs) increased in volume inwMel- andwAlbB-infected cell lines and mosquito tissues compared to cells infected withwPip orWolbachia-free controls. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (required for triacylglycerol biosynthesis) reduced LD formation and significantly restored ER-associated dengue virus replication in cells occupied bywMel.

Currently, no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against dengue virus is available. Innate immunity has been shown to be important for host resistance to DENV infection. Although protein kinase regulated by double-stranded RNA (PKR) has been found to promote the innate signaling in response to infection by several viruses, its role in the innate response to DENV infection is still unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the role of PKR in DENV-induced innate immune responses.Methodology/principal findings:By RNAi, silencing of PKR significantly enhanced the expression of interferon (IFN)-β in DENV infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy data showed that PKR knockdown upregulated the activation of innate signaling cascades including p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), interferon regulatory factor-3 and NF-κB, following DENV2 infection. Likewise, a negative regulatory effect of PKR on the IFN production was also observed in poly(IC) challenged cells. Moreover, the PKR knockdown-mediated IFN induction was attenuated by RIG-I or IPS-1 silencing. Finally, overexpression of a catalytically inactive PKR mutant (K296R), but not of a mutant lacking dsRNA binding activity (K64E) or the double mutant (K64EK296R), reversed the IFN induction mediated by PKR knockdown, suggesting that the dsRNA binding activity is required for PKR to downregulate IFN production.Conclusions/significance:PKR acts as a negative regulator of IFN induction triggered by DENVs and poly(IC), and this regulation relies on its dsRNA binding activity. These findings reveal a novel regulatory role for PKR in innate immunity, suggesting that PKR might be a promising target for anti-DENV treatments."""

Such cross-reactive immunological responses thereby induce between-strain competition within the pathogen population. However, in some cases such as dengue virus, evidence suggests that cross-reactive antibodies act to enhance rather than restrict the severity of a subsequent infection by another strain. This cooperative mechanism is thought to explain why pre-existing immunity to dengue virus is an important risk factor for the development of severe disease (i.e., dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). In this paper, we explore the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics of multistrain pathogen populations. We show that enhancement frequently may generate complex and persistent cyclical or chaotic epidemic behavior. Furthermore, enhancement acts to permit the coexistence of all strains where in its absence only one or a subset would persist."""

Affinity purification combined with quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, has become one of the most powerful tools for the investigation on novel protein-protein interactions. Using this approach, we report here that a significant number of bait-interacting proteins do not dissociate under standard elution conditions, i.e. acid pH and chaotropic agents, and that this problem can be circumvented by using the """"on-matrix"""" digestion procedure described here. This procedure enabled the identification of 16 human plasma proteins interacting with domain III from the envelope protein of DENV serotypes 1, 3 and 4 that would have not been detected otherwise and increased the known DIIIE interactors in human plasma to 59 proteins. Selected Reaction Monitoring analysis evidenced DENV interactome in human plasma is rather conserved although significant differences on the reactivity of viral serotypes with specific proteins do exist. A comparison between the serotype-dependent profile of reactivity and the conservation pattern of amino acid residues suggests an evolutionary selection of highly conserved interactions with the host and other interactions mediated for surface regions of higher variability. SIGNIFICANCE: False negative results on the identification of interacting proteins in pull-down experiments compromise the subsequent interpretation of results and the formulation of a working hypothesis for the derived future work. In this study we demonstrate the presence of bait-interacting proteins reluctant to dissociate under elution conditions of acid pH and presence of chaotropics. We propose the direct proteolytic digestion of proteins while still bound to the affinity matrix (""""on-matrix"""" digestion) and evaluate the impact of this methodology in the comparative study of the interactome of the four serotypes of Dengue virus mediated by the domain III of the viral envelope glycoprotein. Fifty nine proteins were identified as putative interaction partners of Dengue virus (IPs) either due to direct binding or by co-isolation with interacting proteins. Collectively the IPs identified from the pull-down with the recombinant domain III proteins representing the four viral serotypes, 29% were identified only after """"on-matrix"""" digestion which demonstrate the usefulness of this method of recovering bait-bound proteins. Results highlight a particular importance of """"on-matrix"""" digestion procedure for comparative studies where a stronger interaction with one of the interest baits could prevent a bound protein to elute under standard conditions thus leading to misinterpretation as absent in the interactome of this particular bait. The analysis of the Interaction Network indicates that Dengue virus interactome mediated by the domain III of the envelope protein is rather conserved in the viral complex suggesting a key role of these interactions for viral infection thus making candidates to explore for potential biomarkers of clinical outcome in DENV-caused disease. Interestingly, some particular IPs exhibit significant differences in the strength of the interaction with the viral serotypes representing interactions that involve more variable regions in the surface of the domain III. Since such variable regions are the consequence of the interaction with antibodies generated by human immune response; this result relates the interaction with proteins from human plasma with the interplay of the virus and the human immune system."""

Despite the establishment of mosquito C-type lectin domain containing proteins (CTLDcps) as known host factors in assisting the infectious process for flaviviruses, little is known about the structural characteristics of these proteins and their relationships to each other. In this report, we describe the manual annotation and structural characterization of 52Aedes aegyptiCTLDcps. Using existing RNAseq data, we establish that these genes can be subdivided into two classes: those highly conserved with expression primarily in development (embryo/early larvae) and those with no clear orthologs with expression primarily in late larvae/pupae or adults. The latter group contained all CTLDcps that are regulated by the Toll/Imd immune pathways, all known microbiome-regulating CTLDcps, and almost all CTLDcps that are implicated as flavivirus host factors inA. aegypti. Finally, we attempt to synthesize results from multiple conflicting gene expression profiling experiments in terms of how flavivirus infection changes steady-state levels of mRNA encoding CTLDcps."""

An effective vaccine against dengue requires long-term humoral and cellular immune responses. Several viral proteins have been the subjects of intense research, especially the envelope (E) protein, aimed at developing a vaccine. Domain III of the envelope protein (EDIII) has been identified as a potential candidate because it is involved in binding to host cell receptors and contains epitopes that elicit virus neutralizing antibodies. However, this domain is not sufficiently antigenic when is expressed and administered as antigen to elicit a strong immune response. One alternative to enhance immunogenicity is to target the antigen to dendritic cells to induce T-cells for broad antibody responses. In this work, a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) raised against the DEC-205 receptor fused with the EDIII was successfully expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The recombinant protein was expressed and purified from the plant and evaluated in BALB/c mice to test its immunogenicity and ability to induce neutralizing antibodies against DENV. The mice immunized with the recombinant protein produced specific and strong humoral immune responses to DENV. Only two immunizations were required to generate a memory response to DENV without the presence of adjuvants. Also, recognition of the recombinant protein with sera from DENV-infected patients was observed. These findings suggest that this strategy has potential for development of an effective vaccine against DENV."""

Moreover, celgosivir modulates the host's unfolded protein response (UPR) for its antiviral action. Significantly, celgosivir is effective in lethal challenge mouse models that recapitulate primary or secondary antibody-dependent enhanced DENV infection. Celgosivir treated mice showed enhanced survival, reduced viremia and robust immune response, as reflected by serum cytokine analysis. Importantly, survival increased even after treatment was delayed till 2 days post-infection.

Here we report that HCV induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), which in turn activates the autophagic pathway to promote HCV RNA replication in human hepatoma cells. Further analysis revealed that the entire autophagic process through to complete autolysosome maturation was required to promote HCV RNA replication and that it did so by suppressing innate antiviral immunity. Gene silencing or activation of the UPR-autophagy pathway activated or repressed, respectively, IFN-β activation mediated by an HCV-derived pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Similar results were achieved with a PAMP derived from Dengue virus (DEV), indicating that HCV and DEV may both exploit the UPR-autophagy pathway to escape the innate immune response.

Evidences generated in experimental models, as well as the immune responses elicited by infected individuals, showed that induction of anti-NS1 immunity correlates with protective immunity but may also result in the generation of cross-reactive antibodies that recognize platelets and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade. In the present work, we evaluated the immune responses, protection to type 2 dengue virus (DENV2) challenges and safety parameters in BALB/c mice vaccinated with a recombinant NS1 protein in combination with three different adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide (alum), Freund's adjuvant (FA) or a genetically detoxified derivative of the heat-labile toxin (LT(G33D)), originally produced by some enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains. Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) immunized with different vaccine formulations and the induced NS1-specific responses, including serum antibodies and T cell responses, were measured. Mice were also subjected to lethal challenges with the DENV2 NGC strain. The results showed that maximal protective immunity (50%) was achieved in mice vaccinated with NS1 in combination with LT(G33D). Analyses of the NS1-specific immune responses showed that the anti-virus protection correlated mainly with the serum anti-NS1 antibody responses including higher avidity to the target antigen. Mice immunized with LT(G33D) elicited a prevailing IgG2a subclass response and generated antibodies with stronger affinity to the antigen than those generated in mice immunized with the other vaccine formulations. The vaccine formulations were also evaluated regarding induction of deleterious side effects and, in contrast to mice immunized with the FA-adjuvanted vaccine, no significant hepatic damage or enhanced C-reactive protein levels were detected in mice immunized with NS1 and LT(G33D.) Similarly, no detectable alterations in bleeding time and hematological parameters were detected in mice vaccinated with NS1 and LT(G33D). Altogether, these results indicate that the combination of a purified recombinant NS1 and a nontoxic LT derivative is a promising alternative for the generation of safe and effective protein-based anti-dengue vaccine."""

The most striking in vivo example of ADE in humans is dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease in which ADE is thought to increase the severity of clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection by increasing virus replication. We examine the epidemiological impact of ADE on the prevalence and persistence of viral serotypes. Using a dynamical system model of n cocirculating dengue serotypes, we find that ADE may provide a competitive advantage to those serotypes that undergo enhancement compared with those that do not, and that this advantage increases with increasing numbers of cocirculating serotypes. Paradoxically, there are limits to the selective advantage provided by increasing levels of ADE, because greater levels of enhancement induce large amplitude oscillations in incidence of all dengue virus infections, threatening the persistence of both the enhanced and nonenhanced serotypes. Although the models presented here are specifically designed for dengue, our results are applicable to any epidemiological system in which partial immunity increases pathogen replication rates. Our results suggest that enhancement is most advantageous in settings where multiple serotypes circulate and where a large host population is available to support pathogen persistence during the deep troughs of ADE-induced large amplitude oscillations of virus replication."""

Chemokines primarily orchestrate leukocyte recruitment to the areas of viral infection, which makes them critical mediators of immune and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated the induction and function of chemokines in mice early after infection with dengue virus in vivo. We found that CXCL10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression was rapidly and transiently induced in liver following infection. The expressed CXCL10/IP-10 likely mediates the recruitment of activated NK cells, given that anti-CXCL10/IP-10-treated mice showed diminished NK cell infiltration and reduced hepatic expression of effector molecules in activated NK cells after dengue virus infection. Of particular interest, we found that CXCL10/IP-10 also was able to inhibit viral binding to target cells in vitro. Further investigation revealed that various CXCL10/IP-10 mutants, in which the residues that mediate the interaction between the chemokine and heparan sulfate were substituted, failed to exert the inhibitory effect on dengue binding, which suggests that CXCL10/IP-10 competes with dengue virus for binding to heparan sulfate on the cell surface. Moreover, subsequent plaque assays showed that this inhibition of dengue binding blocked viral uptake and replication.

However, no vaccine or specific antiviral is available for dengue. As seen in other RNA viruses, the innate immune system plays a key role in controlling DENV infection and disease outcome. Although the interferon (IFN) response, which is central to host protective immunity, has been reported to limit DENV replication, the molecular details of how DENV infection is modulated by IFN treatment are elusive. In this study, by employing a gain-of-function screen using a type I IFN-treated cell-derived cDNA library, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C19orf66, as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that inhibits DENV replication, which we named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN). Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments revealed that expression of RyDEN confers resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN expression also limited the replication of hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, Chikungunya virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human adenovirus. Importantly, RyDEN was considered to be a crucial effector molecule in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. When affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was performed, RyDEN was revealed to form a complex with cellular mRNA-binding proteins, poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), and La motif-related protein 1 (LARP1). Interestingly, PABPC1 and LARP1 were found to be positive modulators of DENV replication. Since RyDEN influenced intracellular events on DENV replication and, suppression of protein synthesis from DENV-based reporter construct RNA was also observed in RyDEN-expressing cells, our data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells."""

We used a mouse-adapted DENV serotype 2 strain that causes a disease that resembles severe dengue in humans.

C57BL/6 mice deficient in iNKT cells (Jα18(-/-)) were more resistant to lethal infection than were wild-type animals, and the phenotype was reversed by adoptive transfer of iNKT cells to Jα18(-/-) animals. The absence of iNKT cells in Jα18(-/-) mice was associated with decreased systemic and local inflammatory responses, less liver injury, diminished vascular leak syndrome, and reduced activation of natural killer cells and neutrophils. iNKT cell functions were not necessary for control of primary DENV infection, after either natural endogenous activation or exogenous activation with the canonical iNKT cell agonist α-galactosylceramide. Together, these data reveal a novel and critical role for iNKT cells in the pathogenesis of severe experimental dengue disease."""

We demonstrate here that B cells play a pivotal role in host responses against primary DENV infection in mice. After infection, μMT(-/-) mice showed increased viral loads followed by severe disease manifestation characterized by intense thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, cytokine production and massive liver damage that culminated in death. In addition, we show that poly and monoclonal anti-DENV-specific antibodies can sufficiently increase viral replication through a suppression of early innate antiviral responses and enhance disease manifestation, so that a mostly non-lethal illness becomes a fatal disease resembling human DHF/DSS. Finally, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin containing anti-DENV antibodies confirmed the potential enhancing capacity of subneutralizing antibodies to mediate virus infection and replication and induce severe disease manifestation of DENV-infected mice. Thus, our results show that humoral responses unleashed during DENV infections can exert protective or pathological outcomes and provide insight into the pathogenesis of this important human pathogen."""

Progressive urbanization in Asia and South-Central America and the geographic expansion of Aedes mosquito habitats have accelerated the global spread of dengue, resulting in a continuously increasing number of cases. A cost-effective, safe vaccine conferring protection with ideally a single injection could stop dengue transmission. Current vaccine candidates require several booster injections or do not provide protection against all four serotypes. Here we demonstrate that dengue virus mutants lacking 2'-O-methyltransferase activity are highly sensitive to type I IFN inhibition. The mutant viruses are attenuated in mice and rhesus monkeys and elicit a strong adaptive immune response. Monkeys immunized with a single dose of 2'-O-methyltransferase mutant virus showed 100% sero-conversion even when a dose as low as 1,000 plaque forming units was administrated. Animals were fully protected against a homologous challenge. Furthermore, mosquitoes feeding on blood containing the mutant virus were not infected, whereas those feeding on blood containing wild-type virus were infected and thus able to transmit it. These results show the potential of 2'-O-methyltransferase mutant virus as a safe, rationally designed dengue vaccine that restrains itself due to the increased susceptibility to the host's innate immune response."""

White blood cells (WBCs) play an important role in host immune responses early in arboviral infection. Infected WBCs can also function as 'Trojan horses' and carry viruses into immune-sheltered spaces, including the placenta, testes and brain. Therefore, defining which WBCs are permissive to Zika virus (ZIKV) is critical. Here, we analyse ZIKV infectivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro and from Nicaraguan Zika patients and show CD14+CD16+monocytes are the main target of infection, with ZIKV replication detected in some dendritic cells. The frequency of CD14+monocytes was significantly decreased, while the CD14+CD16+monocyte population was significantly expanded during ZIKV infection compared to uninfected controls. Viral RNA was detected in PBMCs from all patients, but in serum from only a subset, suggesting PBMCs may be a reservoir for ZIKV. In Zika patients, the frequency of infected cells was lower but the percentage of infected CD14+CD16+monocytes was significantly higher compared to dengue cases. The gene expression profile in monocytes isolated from ZIKV- and dengue virus-infected patients was comparable, except for significant differences in interferon-γ, CXCL12, XCL1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 levels. Thus, our study provides a detailed picture of the innate immune profile of ZIKV infection and highlights the important role of monocytes, and CD14+CD16+monocytes in particular."""

DEAD (Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu)-box RNA helicases have been reported to play important roles in viral infection, either as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids or as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses. In this study, we reported that DDX25, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, plays a proviral role in DENV infection. The expression levels of DDX25 mRNA and protein were upregulated in DENV infected cells. During DENV infection, the intracellular viral loads were significantly lower inDDX25silenced cells and higher inDDX25overexpressed cells. Meanwhile, the expression level of type I interferon (IFN) was increased inDDX25siRNA treated cells during viral infection. Consistent with thein vitrofindings, theDdx25-transgenic mice have an increased susceptibility to lethal vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virus challenge. The viremia was significantly higher while the anti-viral cytokine levels were lower inDdx25-transgenic mice. Further, DDX25 modulated RIG-I signaling pathway and blocked IFNβ production, by interrupting IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NFκB activation. Thus, DDX25 is a novel negative regulator of IFN pathway and facilitates RNA virus infection."""

To find host cell modifiers of influenza A H1N1 viral infection, we used a functional genomic screen and identified over 120 influenza A virus-dependency factors with roles in endosomal acidification, vesicular trafficking, mitochondrial metabolism, and RNA splicing. We discovered that the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1, 2, and 3 restrict an early step in influenza A viral replication. The IFITM proteins confer basal resistance to influenza A virus but are also inducible by interferons type I and II and are critical for interferon's virustatic actions. Further characterization revealed that the IFITM proteins inhibit the early replication of flaviviruses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.

We compared the effect of OAS gene family variants on 2 DENV serotypes in cell culture. While both OAS1-p42 and p46 showed antiviral activity against DENV-2, only OAS1-p42 presented anti-DENV-1 activity. Conversely, whereas both OAS3_S381 and R381 variants were able to block DENV-1 infection, the anti-DENV-2 activity observed for OAS3_S381 was largely lost for the R381 variant. By means of an allelic association study of a cohort of 740 patients with dengue, we found a protective effect of OAS3_R381 against shock (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; P < .001). This effect was due to DENV-2 infections (OR, 0.13; P = .007) but was absent for DENV-1, in accordance with the serotype-dependent OAS3 activity found in the functional study.

However, our understanding of the molecular interaction of such flaviviruses with mammalian host cells is limited. WNV encodes only 10 proteins, implying that it may use many cellular proteins for infection. WNV enters the cytoplasm through pH-dependent endocytosis, undergoes cycles of translation and replication, assembles progeny virions in association with endoplasmic reticulum, and exits along the secretory pathway. RNA interference (RNAi) presents a powerful forward genetics approach to dissect virus-host cell interactions. Here we report the identification of 305 host proteins that affect WNV infection, using a human-genome-wide RNAi screen. Functional clustering of the genes revealed a complex dependence of this virus on host cell physiology, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular pathways for successful infection. We further demonstrate a requirement for the ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 in WNV internalization, a post-entry role for the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway in viral infection, and the monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT4 as a viral replication resistance factor. By extending this study to dengue virus, we show that flaviviruses have both overlapping and unique interaction strategies with host cells.

However, much less is known about adenovirus replication and pathogenesis in vivo in a permissive host because of the lack of an adequate animal model. Presently, the most frequently used permissive immunocompetent animal model for human adenovirus infection is the Syrian hamster. Species C human adenoviruses replicate in these animals and cause pathology that is similar to that seen with humans. Here, we report findings with a new Syrian hamster strain in which the STAT2 gene was functionally knocked out by site-specific gene targeting. Adenovirus-infected STAT2 knockout hamsters demonstrated an accentuated pathology compared to the wild-type control animals, and the virus load in the organs of STAT2 knockout animals was 100- to 1000-fold higher than that in wild-type hamsters. Notably, the adaptive immune response to adenovirus is not adversely affected in STAT2 knockout hamsters, and surviving hamsters cleared the infection by 7 to 10 days post challenge. We show that the Type I interferon pathway is disrupted in these hamsters, revealing the critical role of interferon-stimulated genes in controlling adenovirus infection. This is the first study to report findings with a genetically modified Syrian hamster infected with a virus. Further, this is the first study to show that the Type I interferon pathway plays a role in inhibiting human adenovirus replication in a permissive animal model. Besides providing an insight into adenovirus infection in humans, our results are also interesting from the perspective of the animal model: STAT2 knockout Syrian hamster may also be an important animal model for studying other viral infections, including Ebola-, hanta-, and dengue viruses, where Type I interferon-mediated innate immunity prevents wild type hamsters from being effectively infected to be used as animal models."""

In the present study, we evaluated the cellular response of human monocyte-derived DCs (mdDCs) infected with recombinant dengue virus type 1 (DV1) strains carrying a single point mutation in the NS3hel protein (L435S or L480S). Both mutated viruses infect and replicate more efficiently and produce more viral progeny in infected mdDCs compared with the parental, non-mutated virus (vBACDV1). Additionally, global gene expression analysis using cDNA microarrays revealed that the mutated DVs induce the up-regulation of the interferon (IFN) signalling and pattern recognition receptor (PRR) canonical pathways in mdDCs. Pronounced production of type I IFN were detected specifically in mdDCs infected with DV1-NS3hel-mutated virus compared with mdDCs infected with the parental virus. In addition, we showed that the type I IFN produced by mdDCs is able to reduce DV1 infection rates, suggesting that cytokine function is effective but not sufficient to mediate viral clearance of DV1-NS3hel-mutated strains. Our results demonstrate that single point mutations in subdomain 2 have important implications for adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of DV1-NS3hel. Although a direct functional connection between the increased ATPase activity and viral replication still requires further studies, these mutations speed up viral RNA replication and are sufficient to enhance viral replicative capacity in human primary cell infection and circumvent type I IFN activity.

The live virus vaccine was developed to provide resistance to the highly virulent, closely related tick-borne flaviviruses that share protective E epitopes among themselves and with LGT. Toward that end the chimera, initially recovered in mosquito cells, was adapted to grow to high titer in qualified simian Vero cells. When inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.), the Vero cell-adapted LGT TP21/DEN4 chimera remained completely attenuated for SCID mice. Significantly, the chimera protected immunocompetent mice against the most virulent tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Subsequently, rhesus monkeys were immunized in groups of 4 with 10(5) or 10(7) PFU of LGT strain TP21, with 10(5) PFU of DEN4, or with 10(3), 10(5), or 10(7) PFU of the chimera. Each of the monkeys inoculated with DEN4 or LGT TP21 became viremic, and the duration of viremia ranged from 1 to 5 days. In contrast, viremia was detected in only 1 of 12 monkeys inoculated with the LGT TP21/DEN4 chimera; in this instance the level of viremia was at the limit of detection. All monkeys immunized with the chimera or LGT TP21 virus developed a moderate to high level of neutralizing antibodies against LGT TP21 as well as TBEV and were completely protected against subsequent LGT TP21 challenge, whereas monkeys previously immunized with DEN4 virus became viremic when challenged with LGT TP21. These observations suggest that the chimera is attenuated, immunogenic, and able to induce a protective immune response. Furthermore, passive transfer of serum from monkeys immunized with chimera conferred significant protection to mice subsequently challenged with 100 i.p. 50% lethal doses of the highly virulent TBEV. The issue of transmissibility of the chimera by mosquitoes was addressed by inoculating a nonhematophagous mosquito, Toxorhynchites splendens, intrathoracically with the chimera or its DEN4 or LGT parent. Neither the LGT TP21/DEN4 vaccine candidate nor the wild-type LGT TP21 virus was able to infect this mosquito species, which is highly permissive for dengue viruses. Certain properties of the chimera, notably its attenuation for monkeys, its immunogenicity, and its failure to infect a highly permissive mosquito host, make it a promising vaccine candidate for use in immunization against severe disease caused by many tick-borne flaviviruses."""

In these microenvironments of the skin, the presence of DENV initiates a complex interplay among the DENV-infected and non-infected neighboring cells at the initial bite site.

Despite such sequence conservation, we observed clear evidence for mixed infection, with the presence of multiple phylogenetically distinct lineages present within the same host, while the presence of stop codon mutations in some samples suggests the action of complementation. In contrast to some previous studies we observed no relationship between the extent and pattern of DENV-1 genetic diversity and disease severity, immune status, or level of viremia."""

In the same year, the region's first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever was reported, caused by an Asian strain of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) that was distinct from the American subtype circulating previously. Despite the importance of these epidemics, little is known about the rates or determinants of viral spread among island and mainland populations or their directions of movement. We employed a Bayesian coalescent approach to investigate the transmission histories of DENV-2 and DENV-4 since their introduction in 1981 and a parsimony method to assess patterns of strain migration. For both viruses there was an initial invasion phase characterized by an exponential increase in the number of DENV lineages, after which levels of genetic diversity remained constant despite reported fluctuations in DENV-2 and DENV-4 activity. Strikingly, viral lineage numbers increased far more rapidly for DENV-4 than DENV-2, indicative of a more rapid rate of exponential population growth in DENV-4 or a higher rate of geographic dispersal, allowing this virus to move more effectively among localities. We propose that these contrasting dynamics may reflect underlying differences in patterns of host immunity. Despite continued gene flow along particular transmission routes, the overall extent of viral traffic was less than expected under panmixis. Hence, DENV in the Americas has a clear geographic structure that maintains viral diversity between outbreaks."""

While low herd immunity levels to any one of the four antigenic types of DENV predispose populations to outbreaks, viral genetic determinants that confer greater fitness for epidemic spread is an important but poorly understood contributor of dengue outbreaks. Here we report that positive epistasis between the coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome combined to elicit an epidemiologic fitness phenotype associated with the 1994 DENV2 outbreak in Puerto Rico. We found that five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein reduced viral genomic RNA (gRNA) replication rate to achieve a more favorable and relatively more abundant subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a byproduct of host 5'-3' exoribonuclease activity. The resulting increase in sfRNA relative to gRNA levels not only inhibited type I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells through a previously described mechanism, but also enabled sfRNA to compete with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles. We suggest that delivery of sfRNA to new susceptible cells to inhibit type I IFN induction before gRNA replication and without the need for further de novo sfRNA synthesis could form a """"preemptive strike"""" strategy against DENV."""

It is caused by four closely-related dengue viruses (DENVs 1-4). A dengue vaccine that can protect against all four viruses is an unmet public health need. Live attenuated vaccine development efforts have encountered unexpected interactions between the vaccine viruses, raising safety concerns. This has emphasized the need to explore non-replicating dengue vaccine options. Virus-like particles (VLPs) which can elicit robust immunity in the absence of infection offer potential promise for the development of non-replicating dengue vaccine alternatives. We have used the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to develop DENV envelope (E) protein-based VLPs. We designed a synthetic codon-optimized gene, encoding the N-terminal 395 amino acid residues of the DENV-2 E protein. It also included 5' pre-membrane-derived signal peptide-encoding sequences to ensure proper translational processing, and 3' 6× His tag-encoding sequences to facilitate purification of the expressed protein. This gene was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris host and expressed under the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter by methanol induction. Recombinant DENV-2 protein, which was present in the insoluble membrane fraction, was extracted and purified using Ni(2+)-affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. Amino terminal sequencing and detection of glycosylation indicated that DENV-2 E had undergone proper post-translational processing. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of discrete VLPs in the purified protein preparation after dialysis. The E protein present in these VLPs was recognized by two different conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Low doses of DENV-2 E VLPs formulated in alum were immunogenic in inbred and outbred mice eliciting virus neutralizing titers >1,1200 in flow cytometry based assays and protected AG129 mice against lethal challenge (p<0.05). The formation of immunogenic DENV-2 E VLPs in the absence of pre-membrane protein highlights the potential of P. pastoris in developing non-replicating, safe, efficacious and affordable dengue vaccine."""

Here, we tested if these differences could allow us to distinguish serotype-specific from cross-neutralizing antibodies. Using 30 blinded early convalescent serum samples from patients with virologically confirmed dengue, we demonstrate that neutralization in the presence of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in THP-1 correctly identifies the DENV serotype of the infection in 93.3% of the cases compared to 76.7% with plaque reduction neutralization test. Our findings could provide a new approach for evaluating DENV neutralization and suggest that in addition to blocking specific ligand-receptor interactions for viral entry, antibodies must prevent viral uncoating during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis for complete humoral protection."""

The association of the human leukocyte antigen gene (HLA) class I alleles with DHF susceptibility or resistance has been reported in ethnically and geographically distinct populations. Due to these ethnic and viral strain differences, associations occur in each population, independently with a specific allele, which most likely explains the associations of several alleles with DHF.

Our experiment reveals that stably expression of TLR3, 7, 8 on HEK293 enables IL-8 secretion after DENV recognition. By the model of human monocytic cells U937, we demonstrated the trigger of IL-8 after viral recognition of human monocytic cell is primary through TLR3 following endosomal acidification. Silencing of TLR3 in U937 cells significantly blocks the DENV-induced IL-8 production. Besides, the interaction is further corroborated by colocalization of TLR3 and DENV RNA upon DENV internalization.

DENV infection produced a viral titer three times higher in untreated than in IFN-α-treated cells (p < 0.001 at 72 h postinfection [p.i.]). Partial inhibition of DENV replication was associated with reduced expression of MxA and OAS antiviral genes as well as higher SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in DENV-infected cells than in cells treated only with IFN-α.

First, using the predicted secondary structure of the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of DENV-3 to design novel deletions, nine deletion mutant viruses were engineered and found to be viable. Four of nine deletion mutants replicated efficiently in Vero cells and were genetically stable. Second, chimeric rDENV-3 viruses were generated by replacement of the 3'-UTR of the rDENV-3 cDNA clone with that of rDENV-4 or rDEN4Delta30 yielding the rDEN3-3'D4 and rDEN3-3'D4Delta30 viruses, respectively.

To identify patterns of genetic change since DENV-2's reintroduction into the region, molecular evolution in DENV-2 from Puerto Rico (PR) and surrounding countries was examined over a 20 year period of fluctuating disease incidence. Structural genes (over 20 % of the viral genome), which affect viral packaging, host-cell entry and immune response, were sequenced for 91 DENV-2 isolates derived from both low- and high-prevalence years. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that DENV-2 outbreaks in PR have been caused by viruses assigned to subtype IIIb, originally from Asia. Variation amongst DENV-2 viruses in PR has since largely arisen in situ, except for a lineage-replacement event in 1994 that appears to have non-PR New World origins. Although most structural genes have remained relatively conserved since the 1980s, strong evidence was found for positive selection acting on a number of amino acid sites in the envelope gene, which have also been important in defining phylogenetic structure. Some of these changes are exhibited by the multiple lineages present in 1994, during the largest Puerto Rican outbreak of dengue, suggesting that they may have altered disease dynamics, although their functional significance will require further investigation."""

Examination of the equilibrium points leads to a formulation of the basic reproduction rate (Z0) of the disease. With a base set of parameters, Z0 = 1.9 and the model realistically reproduces epidemic transmission in an immunologically naive population. Control of adult mosquitoes by ultra-low volume (ULV) aerosols is simulated by an abrupt decrease in vector densities, followed by gradual recovery of the vector population. The model indicates that ULV has little impact on disease incidence, even when multiple applications are made, although the peak of the epidemic may be delayed.

Here we explored JCV infection potential in Ae. aegypti, the nature of the vector's immune response, and interactions with Wolbachia infection. We show that Ae. aegypti is highly competent for JCV, which grows to high loads and rapidly reaches the saliva after an infectious blood meal. The mosquito immune system responds with strong induction of RNAi and JAK/STAT. Neither the direct effect of viral infection nor the energetic investment in immunity appears to affect mosquito longevity. Wolbachia infection blocked JCV only in the early stages of infection. Wolbachia-induced immunity was small compared to that of JCV, suggesting innate immune priming does not likely explain blocking. We propose two models to explain why Wolbachia's blocking of negative-sense viruses like JCV may be less than that of positive-sense viruses, relating to the slowdown of host protein synthesis and the triggering of interferon-like factors like Vago. In conclusion, we highlight the risk for increased human disease with the predicted future overlap of Ae. aegypti and JCV ranges. We suggest that with moderate Wolbachia-mediated blocking and distinct biology, negative-sense viruses represent a fruitful comparator model to other viruses for understanding blocking mechanisms in mosquitoes."""

Here we investigated the ability of SK1 to modulate dengue virus (DENV) infection in vitro. Overexpression of SK1 did not alter DENV infection; however, targeting SK1 through chemical inhibition resulted in reduced DENV RNA and infectious virus release. DENV infection of SK1⁻/ ⁻ murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in inhibition of infection in an immortalized line (iMEF) but enhanced infection in primary MEFs (1°MEFs). Global cellular gene expression profiles showed expected innate immune mRNA changes in DENV-infected WT but no induction of these responses in SK1⁻/⁻ iMEFs. Reverse transciption PCR demonstrated a low-level induction of IFN-β and poor induction of mRNA for the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10 in DENV-infected SK1⁻/⁻ compared with WT iMEFs. Similarly, reduced induction of ISGs was observed in SK1⁻/⁻ 1°MEFs, even in the face of high-level DENV replication. In both iMEFs and 1°MEFs, DENV infection induced production of IFN-β protein. Additionally, higher basal levels of antiviral factors (IRF7, CXCL10 and OAS1) were observed in uninfected SK1⁻/⁻ iMEFs but not 1°MEFs. This suggests that, in this single iMEF line, lack of SK1 upregulates the basal levels of factors that may protect cells against DENV infection. More importantly, regardless of the levels of DENV replication, all cells that lacked SK1 produced IFN-β but were refractory to induction of ISGs such as viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10. Based on these findings, we propose new roles for SK1 in affecting innate responses that regulate susceptibility to DENV infection."""

Several factors influence the susceptibility of these females to be infected by these arboviruses, such as the activation of the innate immune system through the Toll, immunodeficiency (Imd), JAK-STAT pathways, and the interference of specific antiviral response pathways of RNAi. It is also believed that the presence of non-pathogenic microorganisms in the microbiota of these arthropods could influence this immune response, as it provides a baseline activation of the innate immune system, which may generate resistance against arboviruses.

It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV. Additionally, we show that DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice."""

Here, we demonstrate the role of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 in the inhibition of TBEV infection and in protection against virus-induced cell death. We show that the most significant role is that of IFITM3, including the dissection of its functional motifs by mutagenesis. Furthermore, through the use of CRISPR-Cas9-generated IFITM1/3-knockout monoclonal cell lines, we confirm the role and additive action of endogenous IFITMs in TBEV suppression. However, the results of coculture assays suggest that TBEV might partially escape interferon- and IFITM-mediated suppression during high-density coculture infection when the virus enters naive cells directly from infected donor cells.

TBEV is endemic in northern Asia and Europe; however, due to climate change, new centers of endemicity have arisen. Although effective TBEV vaccines have been approved, vaccination coverage is low, and due to the lack of specific therapeutics, infected individuals depend on their immune responses to control the infection. IFITM proteins are components of the innate antiviral defenses that suppress cell entry of many viral pathogens. However, no studies on the role of IFITM proteins in TBEV infection have been published thus far. Understanding antiviral innate immune responses is crucial for the future development of antiviral strategies. Here, we show the important role of IFITM proteins in the inhibition of TBEV infection and virus-mediated cell death.

It has been shown that eukaryotic exoribonucleases are involved in viral sfRNA production. Additionally, viral and human small RNAs (sRNAs) have also been found in flavivirus-infected cells, especially microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs were first described in eukaryotic cells and in a mature and functional state present as single-stranded 18-24 nt RNA fragments. Their main function is the repression of translation through base pairing with cellular mRNAs, besides other functions, such as mRNA degradation. Canonical miRNA biogenesis involves Drosha and Dicer, however miRNA can also be generated by alternative pathways. In the case of flaviviruses, alternative pathways have been suggested. Both sfRNAs and miRNAs are involved in viral infection and host cell response modulation, representing interesting targets of antiviral strategies.

Interferons induce an antiviral state by stimulating the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs can constrain viral replication, limit tissue tropism, reduce pathogenicity, and inhibit viral transmission. Since VSIV is used as a backbone for multiple oncolytic and vaccine strategies, understanding how ISGs restrict VSIV not only helps in understanding VSIV-induced pathogenesis but also helps us evaluate and understand the safety and efficacy of VSIV-based therapies. Thus, there is a need to identify and characterize the ISGs that possess anti-VSIV activity. Using arrayed ISG expression screening, we identified TRIM69 as an ISG that potently inhibits VSIV. This inhibition was highly specific as multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, HIV-1, Rift Valley fever virus, and dengue virus, were unaffected by TRIM69. Indeed, just one amino acid substitution in VSIV can govern sensitivity/resistance to TRIM69. Furthermore, TRIM69 is highly divergent in human populations and exhibits signatures of positive selection that are consistent with this gene playing a key role in antiviral immunity. We propose that TRIM69 is an IFN-induced inhibitor of VSIV and speculate that TRIM69 could be important in limiting VSIV pathogenesis and might influence the specificity and/or efficacy of vesiculovirus-based therapies.IMPORTANCEVesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) is a veterinary pathogen that is also used as a backbone for many oncolytic and vaccine strategies.

This immune response is typically robust and in general works well to clear viral infections, however, viruses have evolved evasion strategies to combat this, and therefore, a better understanding of how this response works in more detail is needed for the development of novel and effective therapeutics. Lipid droplets (LDs) are intracellular organelles and have historically been thought of simply as cellular energy sources, however, have more recently been recognised as critical organelles in signalling events. Importantly, many viruses are known to take over host cellular production of LDs, and it has traditionally been assumed the sole purpose of this is to supply energy for viral life cycle events. However, our recent work positions LDs as important organelles during the first few hours of an antiviral response, showing that they underpin the production of important antiviral cytokines following viral infection. Following infection of cells with either RNA viruses (Zika, Dengue, Influenza A) or a DNA (Herpes Simplex Virus-1) virus, LDs were rapidly upregulated, and this response was also replicated following stimulation with viral mimic agonists. This upregulation of LDs following infection was transient, and interestingly, did not follow the well described homeostatic mechanism of LD upregulation, instead being controlled by EGFR. The cell's ability to mount an effective immune response was greatly diminished when inhibiting EGFR, thus inhibiting LD upregulation during infection, also leading to an increase in viral replication.

To investigate the link between epitope- and serotype-specificity, we assembled the Dengue Virus Antibody Database, an online repository containing over 400 DENV-specific mAbs, each annotated with information on 1) its origin, including the immunogen, host immune history, and selection methods, 2) binding/neutralization data against all four DENV serotypes, and 3) epitope mapping at the domain or residue level to the DENV E protein. We combined epitope mapping and activity information to determine a residue-level index of epitope propensity and cross-reactivity and generated detailed composite epitope maps of primary and secondary antibody responses.

Mosquito-borne arboviruses present some of the most important examples of emerging and resurgent diseases of global significance.Methods:A strategy has been developed by which host-range mutants of Dengue virus can be constructed by generating deletions in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the E glycoprotein. The host-range mutants produced and selected favored growth in the insect hosts. Mouse trials were conducted to determine if these mutants could initiate an immune response in an in vivo system.Results:The DV2 E protein TMD defined as amino acids 452SWTMKILIGVIITWIG467 was found to contain specific residues which were required for the production of this host-range phenotype. Deletion mutants were found to be stable in vitro for 4 sequential passages in both host cell lines. The host-range mutants elicited neutralizing antibody above that seen for wild-type virus in mice and warrant further testing in primates as potential vaccine candidates.Conclusions:Novel host-range mutants of DV2 were created that have preferential growth in insect cells and impaired infectivity in mammalian cells. This method for creating live, attenuated viral mutants that generate safe and effective immunity may be applied to many other insect-borne viral diseases for which no current effective therapies exist."""

If dengue is usually benign, more severe forms (severe dengue [SD]) may lead to serious complications. The prognosis of SD is currently unreliable. To improve the prognosis, it could be necessary to know the key elements of the pathogenicity of the SD. Many hypotheses have been developed to explain a higher pathogenicity in SD patients. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of the host immune response and of the infecting virus strain. The development of these hypothesis allows to have a better understanding of the pathogenesis and consequently, to provide prognostic candidate-markers of SD, these markers being either associated with the host or with the virus.

Neutrophils exist as a heterogeneous population, and their interaction with pathogens and other immune cells may shape the outcome of the host immune response. Diverse classes of viruses, including the recently identified novel SARS-CoV-2, have shown to alter the various aspects of neutrophil biology, offering possibilities for selective intervention. Here, we review heterogeneity within the neutrophil population, highlighting the functional consequences of circulating phenotypes and their critical involvement in exaggerating protective and pathological immune responses against the viruses. We discuss the recent findings of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 pathology and cover other viruses, where neutrophil biology and NETs are crucial for developing disease severity. In the end, we have also pointed out the areas where neutrophil-mediated responses can be finely tuned to outline opportunities for therapeutic manipulation in controlling inflammation against viral infection."""

Female mosquitoes are infected when they blood-feed on vertebrates, a required step for oogenesis. During this process, mosquitoes encounter high iron loads. Since iron is an essential nutrient for most organisms, including pathogens, one of the defense mechanisms for the host includes sequestration of iron away from the invading pathogen. Here, we determine whether iron availability affects viral replication in mosquitoes.Methods:To elucidate effect of iron availability on mosquito cells during infection, Culex cells were treated with either ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or the iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFX). Real time RT-PCR was performed using ferritin (heavy chain) and NRAMP as a measure of iron homeostasis in cells. To determine iron requirement for viral replication, Culex cells were knocked down for NRAMP using dsRNA. Finally, the results were validated in Culex mosquito-infection model, by treating infected mosquitoes with DFX to reduce iron levels.Results:Our results show that infection of Culex cells led to induction in levels of ferritin (heavy chain) and NRAMP mRNAs in time-dependent manner. Results also showed that treatment of cells with FAC, reduced expression of NRAMP (iron transporter) and increase levels of ferritin (heavy chain). Interestingly, increasing iron levels increased viral titers; while reducing intracellular iron levels, either by NRAMP knock-down or using DFX, reduced viral titers. The results from Culex mosquito infection showed that mosquitoes treated with DFX had reduced viral titers compared with untreated controls in midgut as well as carcass 8 days pi. Saliva from mosquitoes treated with DFX also showed reduced viral titers compared with untreated controls, indicating low viral transmission capacity.Conclusions:Our results indicate that iron is required for viral replication in mosquito cells. Mosquitoes respond to viral infection, by inducing expression of heavy chain ferritin, which sequesters available iron, reducing its availability to virus infected cells. The data indicates that heavy chain ferritin may be part of an immune mechanism of mosquitoes in response to viral infections."""

Severe haematological disease is the exception rather than the rule in dengue virus infection, and probably depends at least in part on the host immune response to the virus. The increased incidence of hepatitis-associated aplasia in east Asia may reflect distribution of an infectious agent, an environmental toxin, or genetic predisposition, but probably represents some combination of these factors. Agents with apparently universal distribution, such as parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus, are associated with bone marrow failure only in a very narrow range of hosts. These examples teach us that viral causes cannot automatically be excluded from the differential diagnosis of syndromes whose occurrence is rare or apparently sporadic. Further investigation of these syndromes should include more detailed characterization of host factors, particularly immunological characteristics, and possible infectious and toxic cofactors which are associated with morbidity."""

LCMV-induced IgG production is largely polyclonal, with more than 90% of the antibody repertoire constituting non-relevant specificities. A delayed virus-neutralizing antibody response is induced, including specificities directed not only against the parental LCMV-strain present in the host but also cross-specifically against LCMV-variants isolated from other hosts.

Assessments of matrix metalloproteinase genes mRNA expressions were done using real-time PCR.Results:In the present study, we have for the first time unveiled that, NS1 antigen of dengue type-2 serotype, induce and stimulate the neutrophils cells to express high levels of matrix metalloproteases. NS1 exposure of HL-60 cells differentiated to neutrophils affected cell morphology and in 24 h of exposure. We have demonstrated that, the NS1 antigen has induced MMP-2, MMP-14 and MMP-9 expressions in neutrophils in a 24hrs exposure time. NS1 exposure has also further upregulated MMP-1, MMP-13, and MMP-8 expressions in neutrophils in a 24hrs exposure time. Notably, treatment with atorvastatin concentrations downregulated the expression profile of the all matrix metalloprotease significantly. Importantly, NS1 antigen has significantly increased the IL-6, IL-13 release by the HL,60 cells which was reversed by atorvastatin. On the other hand, NS1 exposure enhanced the mRNA expressions of VEGF-A and VEGF-D which was reversed by atorvastatin. However, we found that, NS1 exposure reduced the mRNA expressions profile of VEGF-C, which was reversed by atorvastatin.Conclusion:In conclusion, we report that, neutrophils associated matrix metalloprotease are involved in the pathogenesis of dengue viral disease. VEGF growth factors may also be released by the neutrophils which may subsequently participate in the endothelial dysfunctions leading to dengue shock syndrome."""

Among the eleven structural and non-structural proteins of DENV, Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has emerged as a promising target due to its diverse role in modulating the immune response, inducing vascular leakage, and facilitating viral replication and assembly. Monoclonal antibodies are the sole therapeutics to target NS1, but concerns about their cross-reactivity persist. Given these concerns, our study focuses on designing a novel Peptide Ligand Conjugate (PLC) as a potential alternative immunotherapeutic agent against NS1. This PLC aims to mediate the immune elimination of soluble NS1 and NS1-presenting DENV-infected host cells by pre-existing vaccine-induced immunity. By employing the High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) method, QikProp analysis, and Molecular Dynamics studies, we identified three hits from Asinex Biodesigned Ligands out of 220,177 compounds that show strong binding affinity towards the monoclonal binding site of NS1 protein. After a rigorous analysis of physicochemical characteristics, antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity using various servers, we selected two peptides: the minimum epitopic region of the Diphtheria and Tetanus toxins as the peptide components of the PLCs. A non-cleavable, non-reactive oxime linker connected the ligand with the peptide through oxime and amide bonds. DPT vaccine is widely used in dengue-endemic countries, and it has been reported that antibodies titer against MER of Diphtheria toxin and Tetanus toxins persist lifelong in DPT-vaccinated people. Therefore, once the rationally designed PLCs bind to NS1 through the ligands, the peptide will induce an immune response against NS1 by triggering pre-existing DPT antibodies and activating memory cells. This orchestrated immune response will destroy soluble NS1 and NS1-expressing DENV-infected cells, thereby reducing the illness of severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and the DENV infection, respectively. Given the increasing demand for new therapeutics for DENV treatment, further investigation into this novel immune-therapeutic strategy may offer a new avenue for treating mild and severe dengue infections."""

Mosquitoes transmit a variety of viral and parasitic diseases including yellow fever, dengue, malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Simuliid black flies are vectors of river blindness. The diseases are together responsible for death and morbidity in millions of people each year. The relationship between inducible peptides and bacterial and parasitic infections in these insects is proving to be a complex one. The identification of an insect defensin (4 kDa) in Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, has proved to be the first peptide characterized in a vector of human disease. This inducible molecule appears in the haemolymph in response to bacterial and to a lesser extent filarial infection. The characterization of inducible blackfly peptides has revealed potent inducible anti-Gram-positive as well as anti-Gram-negative activity. In addition, non-self recognition molecules such as phenoloxidase may play a part in differentiating one species of eukaryotic pathogen from another of the same genus. The interactions between the peptides and these other proteins are likely to be important in the establishment of a successful immune response against a parasitic pathogen, particularly as we now know these peptides to have anti-eukaryotic activity (against a range of parasite species). As well as being of fundamental interest in our understanding of host-parasite relationships, the indication that antibacterial peptides are toxic to parasitic organisms has implications for their possible use in the disease vector control strategies of the future. It may also mean that a revision in our understanding of their mode of action, loose as it is, has to take place."""

To distinguish these mechanisms in flavivirus infections and immunizations, we studied recall responses to envelope protein domain III (DIII). Conditional deletion of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) between heterologous challenges of West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and dengue viruses did not affect recall responses. DIII-specific MBCs were contained mostly within the plasma-cell-biased CD80+subset, and few GCs arose following heterologous boosters, demonstrating that recall responses are confined by preexisting clonal diversity. Measurement of monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding affinity to DIII proteins, timed AID deletion, single-cell RNA sequencing, and lineage tracing experiments point to selection of relatively low-affinity MBCs as a mechanism to promote diversity.

Here, we show that DENV-immune Ifnar1-/-or wild-type C57BL/6 mice infected with ZIKV have cross-reactive immunity to subsequent ZIKV infection and pathogenesis. Adoptive transfer and cell depletion studies demonstrate that DENV-immune CD8+T cells predominantly mediate cross-protective responses to ZIKV. In contrast, passive transfer studies suggest that DENV-immune serum does not protect against ZIKV infection. Thus, CD8+T cell immunity generated during primary DENV infection can confer protection against secondary ZIKV infection in mice. Further optimization of current DENV vaccines for T cell responses might confer cross-protection and prevent antibody-mediated enhancement of ZIKV infection."""

In this study, we found that curcumin inhibited CSFV replication in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on virus adsorption and entry. Furthermore, the results showed that curcumin inhibited the expression of FASN, one of the key enzymes of fatty acid synthesis pathway, thereby, causing the reduction of the production of LDs upon infection. To this end, we detected transcription factor 6 (ATF6), the key factor of regulating lipid metabolism along with other related molecules (CHOP and GPR78) and found that curcumin significantly impaired the gene synthesis of ATF6, while CSFV infection promoted ATF6 expression. Therefore, it is confirmed that curcumin inhibited CSFV replication by interfere lipid metabolism. In addition, our subsequent studies found that curcumin played an antiviral role by promoting the innate immune independent of NF-κB signaling pathway.

Only a few flavivirus vaccines have been licensed for use in humans: yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and Kyasanur forest disease. However, improvement is necessary in vaccination strategies and in understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved either in the infection or after vaccination. This is especially important in dengue, due to the immunological complexity of its four serotypes, cross-reactive responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and immunological interference. In this context, mucosal vaccines represent a promising alternative against flaviviruses. Mucosal vaccination has several advantages, as inducing long-term protective immunity in both mucosal and parenteral tissues. It constitutes a friendly route of antigen administration because it is needle-free and allows for a variety of antigen delivery systems. This has promoted the development of several ways to stimulate immunity through the direct administration of antigens (e.g., inactivated virus, attenuated virus, subunits, and DNA), non-replicating vectors (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes, bacterial ghosts, and defective-replication viral vectors), and replicating vectors (e.g.,Salmonella enterica,Lactococcus lactis,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and viral vectors). Because of these characteristics, mucosal vaccination has been explored for immunoprophylaxis against pathogens that enter the host through mucosae or parenteral areas. It is suitable against flaviviruses because this type of immunization can stimulate the parenteral responses required after bites from flavivirus-infected insects. This review focuses on the advantages of mucosal vaccine candidates against the most relevant flaviviruses in either humans or animals, providing supporting data on the feasibility of this administration route for future clinical trials."""

Using dengue, hepatitis C, and Zika viruses, we demonstrate that the contact site of pDCs with infected cells is a specialized platform we term the interferogenic synapse, which enables viral RNA transfer and antiviral responses. This synapse is formed via αLβ2integrin-ICAM-1 adhesion complexes and the recruitment of the actin network and endocytic machinery. TLR7 signaling in pDCs promotes interferogenic synapse establishment and provides feed-forward regulation, sustaining pDC contacts with infected cells.

These viruses persist in nature through transmission cycles that involve alternating replication in susceptible vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Collectively, these viruses are among the greatest burdens to global health, due to their widespread prevalence, and the severe morbidity and mortality they cause in human and animal hosts. Specific examples of mosquito-borne pathogens include Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV 1-4), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Interactions between arboviruses and the immune pathways of vertebrate hosts have been extensively reviewed. In this review we focus on the antiviral immune pathways present in mosquitoes. We also discuss mechanisms by which mosquito-borne viruses may antagonize antiviral pathways in disease vectors. Finally, we elaborate on the possibility that mosquito-borne viruses may be engaged in an evolutionary arms race with their invertebrate vector hosts, and the possible implications of this for understanding the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses."""

Consequently, extensive efforts are being made to develop effective treatments and vaccines. Mathematical modeling plays a significant role in comprehending the dynamics of DENV within a host in the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) immune response. This study examines two models for secondary DENV infections that elucidate the dynamics of DENV under the influence of two types of CTL responses, namely non-specific and strain-specific responses. The first model encompasses five compartments, which consist of uninfected monocytes, infected monocytes, free DENV particles, non-specific CTLs, and strain-specific CTLs. In the second model, latently infected cells are introduced into the model. We posit that the CTL responsiveness is determined by a combination of self-regulating CTL response and a predator-prey-like CTL response. The model's solutions are verified to be nonnegativity and bounded and the model possesses two equilibrium states: the uninfected equilibriumEQ0and the infected equilibriumEQ⁎. Furthermore, we calculate the basic reproduction numberR0, which determines the existence and stability of the model's equilibria. We examine the global stability by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our analysis reveals that ifR0≤1, thenEQ0is globally asymptotically stable (G.A.S), and ifR0>1, thenEQ0is unstable whileEQ⁎is G.A.S. To illustrate our findings analytically, we conduct numerical simulations for each model. Additionally, we perform sensitivity analysis to demonstrate how the parameter values of the proposed model impactR0given a set of data. Finally, we discuss the implications of including the CTL immune response and latently infected cells in the secondary DENV infection model. Our study demonstrates that incorporating the CTL immune response and latently infected cells diminishesR0and enhances the system's stability aroundEQ0."""

However, the role of mosquito saliva in modulating host innate immune responses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mosquito salivary gland extract (SGE) inhibits dengue and Zika virus-induced inflammasome activation by reducing NLRP3 expression, Caspase-1 activation, and 1L-1β secretion in cultured human and mice macrophages. As a result, we observe that SGE inhibits virus detection in the early phase of infection.

These viruses take advantage of the mosquito's cell to create an environment conducive for their growth. Arboviral infection triggers transcriptomic and protein dysregulation inAe. aegyptiand in effect, host antiviral mechanisms are compromised. Currently, there are no existing vaccines able to protect human hosts from these infections and thus, vector control strategies such asWolbachiamass release program is regarded as a viable option. Considerable evidence demonstrates how the presence ofWolbachiainterferes with arboviruses by decreasing host cytoskeletal proteins and lipids essential for arboviral infection. Also,Wolbachiastrengthens host immunity, cellular regeneration and causes the expression of microRNAs which could potentially be involved in virus inhibition. However, variation in the magnitude ofWolbachia's pathogen blocking effect that is not due to the endosymbiont's density has been recently reported. Furthermore, the cellular mechanisms involved in this phenotype differs depending onWolbachiastrain and host species. This prompts the need to explore the cellular interactions betweenAe. aegypti-arboviruses-Wolbachiaand how differentWolbachiastrains overall affect the mosquito's cell. Understanding what happens at the cellular and molecular level will provide evidence on the sustainability ofWolbachiavector control."""

The unbiased repertoire analysis showed dramatic changes in the usage of antibody variable region germline genes. However, lineage tracing of ZK2B10 revealed limited somatic hypermutation and transient expansion during the 12 months following the onset of symptoms.

We recently demonstrated that primary human Sertoli cells (hSeC) were highly susceptible to ZIKV as compared to dengue virus without causing cell death and thus may act as a reservoir for ZIKV in the testes. However, the cellular and immune responses of hSeC to infection with ZIKV or any other virus are not yet characterized. Using genome-wide RNA-seq to compare immunoprofiles of hSeC, we show that the most prominent response to ZIKV at early stage of infection was suppression of cell growth and proliferation functional pathways. Peak virus replication was associated with induction of multiple antiviral defense pathways. Unique ZIKV-associated signatures included dysregulation of germ cell-Sertoli cell junction signaling. This study demonstrates that hSeC are capable of signaling through canonical pro-inflammatory pathways and provides insights into unique cell-type-specific response induced by ZIKV in association with viral persistence in the testes."""

The activation of Fcγ receptors usually leads to phagocytosis. Paradoxically, the ligation of monocyte or macrophage Fcγ receptors by IgG immune complexes, rather than aiding host defences, can suppress innate immunity, increase production of interleukin 10, and bias T-helper-1 (Th1) responses to Th2 responses, leading to increased infectious output by infected cells. This intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection modulates the severity of diseases as disparate as dengue haemorrhagic fever and leishmaniasis.

Arthropod-specific pattern recognition receptors and protease cascades detect and respond to infection. Proteins such as antimicrobial peptides, thioester-containing proteins, and transglutaminases effect responses such as lysis, phagocytosis, melanization, and agglutination. Effector responses are initiated by damage signals such as reactive oxygen species signaling from epithelial cells and recognized by cell surface receptors on hemocytes.

Heterologous secondary infections have been associated to a greater risk of potentially fatal dengue due to non-neutralizing memory antibodies (Abs), which facilitate the infection, such as anti-precursor membrane (prM) Abs, among other mechanisms. Usually, class-switched memory Abs are generated mainly through germinal centers (GCs). However, the cellular events underlying these Ab responses to DENV, especially during repeated/secondary infections, have been poorly studied. We wanted to know whether there is involvement of GC reactions during cutaneous DENV infection and whether there is any sort of preferential Ab responses to defined viral proteins. Intradermal DENV inoculation at a relatively low dose efficiently infects immune-competent BALB/c mice, inducing higher quantities of DENV-specific GC B cells and larger GCs than the control conditions. Interestingly, GCs exhibited as much prM as envelope (E) and non-structural 3 viral proteins in situ. Intriguingly, despite the much larger abundance of E protein than of prM protein in the virions, infected animals showed similar amounts of circulating Abs and Ag-specific GC B cells both for prM and for E proteins, even significantly higher for prM. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of the GC responses during DENV infection. This relatively stronger anti-prM response could be triggered by DENV to preferentially promote Abs against certain viral proteins, which might favor infections by facilitating DENV invasion of host cells. It is thus conceivably that DENV might have evolved to induce this kind of Ab responses."""

Our data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells, macrophages and monocytes, which express variable levels of FcγR, could be enhanced by convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients. We also determined the factors associated with ADE, and found which showed a time-dependent but not viral-dose dependent manner.

Consequently, vimentin has complex implications in pathophysiology. Vimentin is required for a proper immune response, but it can also act as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases or as a damage signal. Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage. At the cell surface, vimentin can act as a receptor for bacterial and viral pathogens. Indeed, vimentin has been shown to play important roles in virus attachment and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue and encephalitis viruses, among others. Moreover, the presence of vimentin in specific virus-targeted cells and its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and tissue damage contribute to its implication in viral infection. Here, we recapitulate some of the pathophysiological implications of vimentin, including the involvement of cell surface vimentin in interaction with pathogens, with a special focus on its role as a cellular receptor or co-receptor for viruses. In addition, we provide a perspective on approaches to target vimentin, including antibodies or chemical agents that could modulate these interactions to potentially interfere with viral pathogenesis, which could be useful when multi-target antiviral strategies are needed."""

We then show that BALB/c mice inoculated with SVPs purified from pcDNA(3)-prM/E-transfected COS-7 cell supernatants are protected from lethal challenge with the virulent prototype strain MVE-1-51 and that this protection correlates with the development of a neutralising humoral immune response by the host. By contrast, prior immunisation with cell-associated, recombinant MVE envelope glycoproteins did not protect mice from challenge with MVE-1-51 and this was associated with the development of antibody that was unable to neutralise virus infectivity in vitro.

At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same and designing animal models depends on understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in humans. The implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, because ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies-regardless of what virus is the causative agent-it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward."""

The consequences of climate changes are numerous and can affect human health through direct (extreme events, natural disasters) or indirect (alteration of the ecosystem) mechanisms. Climate changes have repercussions on ecosystems, agriculture, social conditions, migration, conflicts and the transmission mode of infectious diseases. Vector-borne diseases are infections transmitted by the bite of infected arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, triatomines, sand flies and flies. Epidemiological cornerstones of vector-borne diseases are: the ecology and behaviour of the host, the ecology and behaviour of the vector, and the population's degree of immunity. Mosquito vectors related to human diseases mainly belong to the genus Culex, Aedes and Mansonia. Climate changes in Europe have increased the spread of new vectors, such as Aedes albopictus, and in some situations have made it possible to sustain the autochthonous transmission of some diseases (outbreak of Chukungunya virus in northern Italy in 2007, cases of dengue in the South of France and in Croatia). Despite the eradication of malaria from Europe, anopheline carriers are still present, and they may allow the transmission of the disease if the climatic conditions favour the development of the vectors and their contacts with plasmodium carriers. The tick Ixodes ricinus is a vector whose expansion has been documented both in latitude and in altitude in relation to the temperature increase; at the same time the related main viral and bacterial infections have increased. In northern Italy and Germany, the appearance of Leishmaniasis has been associated to climatic conditions that favour the development of the vector Phlebotomus papatasi and the maturation of the parasite within the vector, although the increase of cases of visceral leishmaniasis is also related to host immune factors, particularly immunodepression caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite the importance of global warming in facilitating the transmission of certain infectious diseases, due consideration must be taken of the role played by other variables, such as the increase in international travel, migration and trade, with the risk of importing parasites and vectors with the goods. In addition, the control of certain infections was possible in the past through improvements in socio-economic conditions of affected populations. However, the reduction in resources allocated to health care has recently led to the re-emergence of diseases that were considered eradicated."""

Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes.

All of the tested capsid proteins protected cells from Fas-dependent apoptosis through a mechanism that requires activated Akt. Capsid expression upregulated other Akt-dependent cellular processes including expression of glucose transporter 1 and mitochondrial metabolism. Protein phosphatase 1, which is known to inactivate Akt, was identified as a DENV capsid interacting protein. This suggests that DENV capsid expression activates Akt by sequestering phosphatases that downregulate phospho-Akt.

In the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the main dengue virus (DENV) vector worldwide, statistical associations between host genetic markers and DENV types or strains were previously detected, but the host genes underlying this genetic specificity have not been identified. In particular, it is unknown whether DENV type- or strain-specific resistance relies on allelic variants of the same genes or on distinct gene sets. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of DENV resistance in a population of Ae. aegypti from Bakoumba, Gabon, which displays a stronger resistance phenotype to DENV type 1 (DENV-1) than to DENV type 3 (DENV-3) infection. Following experimental exposure to either DENV-1 or DENV-3, we sequenced the exomes of large phenotypic pools of mosquitoes that are either resistant or susceptible to each DENV type. Using variation in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies among the pools, we computed empirical p values based on average gene scores adjusted for the differences in SNP counts, to identify genes associated with infection in a DENV type-specific manner. Among the top 5% most significant genes, 263 genes were significantly associated with resistance to both DENV-1 and DENV-3, 287 genes were only associated with DENV-1 resistance and 290 were only associated with DENV-3 resistance. The shared significant genes were enriched in genes with ATP binding activity and sulfur compound transmembrane transporter activity, whereas the genes uniquely associated with DENV-3 resistance were enriched in genes with zinc ion binding activity. Together, these results indicate that specific resistance to different DENV types relies on largely non-overlapping sets of genes in this Ae. aegypti population and pave the way for further mechanistic studies."""

Western blot analysis was also performed to confirm the proteomic data. Potential roles of these altered proteins were discussed. The present study provides valuable large-scale protein-related information for elucidating the functional emphasis of host cell proteins and their post-translational modifications in virus infection, and also provides insight and protein evidence for understanding the general pathogenesis and pathology of DENV."""

Because of the lack of a vaccine and antiviral drugs, the sole measure of control is limiting the Aedes mosquito vectors. DENV infection can be asymptomatic or a self-limited, acute febrile disease ranging in severity. The classical form of dengue fever (DF) is characterized by high fever, headache, stomach ache, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. Severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are accompanied by thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and hypotension. DSS, which can be fatal, is characterized by systemic shock. Despite intensive research, the underlying mechanisms causing severe dengue is still not well understood partly due to the lack of appropriate animal models of infection and disease. However, even though it is clear that both viral and host factors play important roles in the course of infection, a fundamental knowledge gap still remains to be filled regarding host cell tropism, crucial host immune response mechanisms, and viral markers for virulence."""

Arboviruses form an emerging group of medically important viral pathogens that are transmitted to humans and animals via arthropod vectors, mostly mosquitoes, ticks or midges. Few arboviral vaccines are currently available, but there is a growing need for safe and effective vaccines against some highly pathogenic arboviruses such as Chikungunya, dengue, West Nile, Rift Valley fever and Bluetongue viruses. This comprehensive review discusses the biology and current state of the art in vaccine development for arboviruses belonging to the families Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae and Reoviridae and the potential of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for vaccine antigen production The members of three of these four arbovirus families have enveloped virions and display immunodominant glycoproteins with a complex structure at their surface. Baculovirus expression of viral antigens often leads to correctly folded and processed (glyco)proteins able to induce protective immunity in animal models and humans. As arboviruses occupy a unique position in the virosphere in that they also actively replicate in arthropod cells, the baculovirus-insect cell expression system is well suited to produce arboviral proteins with correct folding and post-translational processing. The opportunities for recombinant baculoviruses to aid in the development of safe and effective subunit and virus-like particle vaccines against arboviral diseases are discussed."""

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was recently identified as a host factor for Zika and dengue viruses; AHR antagonists boost antiviral immunity, decrease viral titers and ameliorate Zika-induced pathology in vivo. Here we report that AHR is activated by infection with different coronaviruses, potentially impacting antiviral immunity and lung epithelial cells. Indeed, the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq from lung tissue detected increased expression of AHR and AHR transcriptional targets, suggesting AHR signaling activation in SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells from COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we detected an association between AHR expression and viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Finally, we found that the pharmacological inhibition of AHR suppressed the replication in vitro of one of the causative agents of the common cold, HCoV-229E, and the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these findings suggest that AHR activation is a common strategy used by coronaviruses to evade antiviral immunity and promote viral replication, which may also contribute to lung pathology. Future studies should further evaluate the potential of AHR as a target for host-directed antiviral therapy."""

The fungus kills without adhering to the host cuticle. Ingested conidia also fail to germinate and are expelled in fecal pellets. This study investigates the mechanism by which this fungus adapted to terrestrial hosts kills aquatic mosquito larvae. Genes associated with the M. anisopliae early pathogenic response (proteinases Pr1 and Pr2, and adhesins, Mad1 and Mad2) are upregulated in the presence of larvae, but the established infection process observed in terrestrial hosts does not progress and insecticidal destruxins were not detected. Protease inhibitors reduce larval mortality indicating the importance of proteases in the host interaction. The Ae. aegypti immune response to M. anisopliae appears limited, whilst the oxidative stress response gene encoding for thiol peroxidase is upregulated. Cecropin and Hsp70 genes are downregulated as larval death occurs, and insect mortality appears to be linked to autolysis through caspase activity regulated by Hsp70 and inhibited, in infected larvae, by protease inhibitors. Evidence is presented that a traditional host-pathogen response does not occur as the species have not evolved to interact. M. anisopliae retains pre-formed pathogenic determinants which mediate host mortality, but unlike true aquatic fungal pathogens, does not recognise and colonise the larval host."""

In this report, we generated fully infectious tagged influenza viruses and used infection-based proteomics to identify pivotal arms of cellular signaling required for influenza virus growth and infectivity. Using mathematical modeling and genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we revealed that modulation of Sec61-mediated cotranslational translocation selectively impaired glycoprotein proteostasis of influenza as well as HIV and dengue viruses and led to inhibition of viral growth and infectivity.

With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection around the world, disease severity is influenced by the immunological status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to natural infection. Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease.

We show that the nonstructural protein NS2A of dengue virus-2 (DENV2) act as a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR). When NS2A-mediated RNAi suppression was disabled, the resulting mutant DENV2 induced Dicer-dependent production of abundant DENV2-derived siRNAs in differentiated mammalian cells. VSR-disabled DENV2 showed severe replication defects in mosquito and mammalian cells and in mice that were rescued by RNAi deficiency. Moreover, NS2As of multiple flaviviruses act as VSRs in vitro and during viral infection in both organisms.

While TSV01 infection led to activation of type I antiviral genes such as EIF2AK2 (PKR), OAS, ADAR and MX, these responses were absent in NGC-infected cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that NGC but not TSV01 suppressed STAT-1 and STAT-2 activation in response to type I IFN (alpha and beta). However, these two strains did not differ in their response to type II IFN (gamma).

Yet there is increasing evidence for the importance of the innate immune system in regulating dengue infection and possibly influencing the disease. This review focuses on the interplay between the innate immune system and dengue and highlights the role of soluble immunological mediators. Type I and type II interferons of the innate immune system demonstrate non-overlapping roles in dengue infection. Furthermore, while some IFN responses to dengue are protective, others may exert disease-related effects on the host. But aside from interferons, a number of cytokines have also been implicated in dengue pathogenesis. Our expanding knowledge of cytokines indicates that these soluble mediators act upon a complicated network of events to provoke the disease. This cytokine storm is generally attributed to massive T cell activation as an outcome of secondary infection. However, there is reason to believe that innate immune response-derived cytokines also have contributory effects, especially in the context of severe cases of primary dengue infection. Another less popular but interesting perspective on dengue pathogenesis is the effect of mosquito feeding on host immune responses and viral infection. Various studies have shown that soluble factors from vector saliva have the capacity to alter immune reactions and thereby influence pathogen transmission and establishment. Hence, modulation of the innate immune system at various levels of infection is a critical component of dengue disease. In the absence of an approved drug or vaccine for dengue, soluble mediators of the innate immune system could be a strategic foothold for developing anti-viral therapeutics and improving clinical management."""

Why these viruses can cause profound pathologies in humans, while natural reservoir hosts often show little evidence of disease is not completely understood. Differences in the host immune response, especially within the innate compartment, have been suggested to be involved in this divergence.

The importance of nuclear DENV NS5 on viral replication and pathogenesis is still unclear. We recently discovered a nuclear localization signal (NLS) residing in the C-terminal 18 amino acid (Cter18) region of DENV NS5 and that a single NS5 P884T amino acid substitution adjacent to the NLS is sufficient to relocalize a significant proportion of DENV2 NS5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells. Here,in vitrostudies show that the DENV2 NS5 P884T mutant replicates similarly to the parental wild-type infectious clone-derived virus while inducing a greater type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine response, in a manner independent of NS5's ability to degrade STAT2 or regulate SAT1 splicing. In both AG129 mouse andAedes aegyptimosquito infection models, the P884T virus exhibits lower levels of viral replication only at early timepoints. Intriguingly, there appears to be a tendency for selection pressure to revert to the wild-type proline in P884T-infectedAe. aegypti, in agreement with the high conservation of the proline at this position of NS5 in DENV2, 3, and 4.

However, a major concern in the development of vaccines against ZIKV and the related dengue virus is the induction of cross-reactive poorly neutralizing antibodies that can cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. This risk necessitates particular care in vaccine design. Specifically, the engineered immunogens should have their cross-reactive epitopes masked, and they should be optimized for eliciting virus-specific strongly neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination. Here, we developed ZIKV subunit- and virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines displaying E in its wild-type form or E locked in a covalently linked dimeric (cvD) conformation to enhance the exposure of E dimers to the immune system. Compared with their wild-type derivatives, cvD immunogens elicited antibodies with a higher capacity to neutralize virus infection in cultured cells. More importantly, these immunogens protected animals from lethal challenge with both the African and Asian lineages of ZIKV, impairing virus dissemination to brain and sexual organs. Moreover, the locked conformation of E reduced the exposure of epitopes recognized by cross-reactive antibodies and therefore showed a lower potential to induce ADEin vitroOur data demonstrated a higher efficacy of the VLPs in comparison with that of the soluble dimer and support VLP-cvD as a promising ZIKV vaccine.IMPORTANCEInfection with Zika virus (ZIKV) leads to the production by the host of antibodies that target the viral surface envelope (E) protein. A subset of these antibodies can inhibit virus infection, thus making E a suitable candidate for the development of vaccine against the virus. However, the anti-ZIKV E antibodies can cross-react with the E protein of the related dengue virus on account of the high level of similarity exhibited by the two viral proteins. Such a scenario may lead to severe dengue disease. Therefore, the design of a ZIKV vaccine requires particular care. Here, we tested two candidate vaccines containing a recombinant form of the ZIKV E protein that is forced in a covalently stable dimeric conformation (cvD). They were generated with an explicit aim to reduce the exposure of the cross-reactive epitopes. One vaccine is composed of a soluble form of the E protein (sE-cvD), the other is a more complex virus-like particle (VLP-cvD). We used the two candidate vaccines to immunize mice and later infected them with ZIKV. The animals produced a high level of inhibitory antibodies and were protected from the infection.

Therefore, we investigate the role of MCs in the development of virus-specific CD8+T cell responses using the well-characterized murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model and the transgenic MasTRECK mice that contain the human diphtheria toxin receptor as an inducible MC-deficient model. Here, we report that MCs are essential for the activation and expansion of virus-specific CD8+T cells. After MC depletion and subsequent intradermal LCMV infection, the CD8+T cell effector phenotype and antiviral cytokine production were impaired at the peak of infection (day 8 p.i.). Importantly, MC-deficient mice were unable to control the infection and exhibited significantly higher viral loads in the spleen and in the ear draining lymph nodes compared to that of wild type control mice. In the absence of MCs, dendritic cell (DC) activation was impaired upon LCMV infection. In addition, type-I interferon (IFN) levels in the serum and in the spleen of MC-deficient mice were reduced during the first days of infection. Interestingly, depletion of MCs after intradermal LCMV infection did not impair virus-specific CD8+T cell expansion, activation or antiviral cytokine production. In summary, our results indicate that MCs play a pivotal role in the activation and antiviral functions of CD8+T cells through proper DC activation. A better understanding of the impact of MCs on CD8+T cell responses is mandatory to improve antiviral immune responses."""

The expression of HERVs has always been a cause for concern because of its association with various cancers and diseases. However, few previous studies have focused on specific activation of HERVs by viral infections. Our previous study has shown that dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection induces the transcription of a large number of abnormal HERVs loci; therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between exogenous viral infection and HERV activation further. In this study, we retrieved and reanalyzed published data on 21 transcriptomes of human cells infected with various viruses. We found that infection with different viruses could induce transcriptional activation of HERV loci. Through the comparative analysis of all viral datasets, we identified 43 key HERV loci that were up-regulated by DENV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Zika virus, measles virus, and West Nile virus infections. Furthermore, the neighboring genes of these HERVs were simultaneously up-regulated, and almost all such neighboring genes were interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are enriched in the host's antiviral immune response pathways. Our data supported the hypothesis that activation of HERVs, probably via an interferon-mediated mechanism, plays an important role in innate immunity against viral infections."""

Viral infections, a significant cause of sight-threatening ocular diseases in the posterior segment, include human herpesviruses, measles, rubella, and arboviruses such as dengue, West Nile, and chikungunya virus. Viral posterior uveitis may occur as an isolated ocular disease in congenital or acquired infections or as part of a systemic viral illness. Many viruses remain latent in the infected host with a risk of reactivation that depends on various factors, including virulence and host immunity, age, and comorbidities. Although some viral illnesses are self-limiting and have a good visual prognosis, others, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis or acute retinal necrosis, may result in serious complications and profound vision loss. Since some of these infections may respond well to antiviral therapy, it is important to work up all cases of posterior uveitis to rule out an infectious etiology.

DENV as a mosquito-borne virus infects human hosts through the skin; however, the initial target cells in the skin remain unclear. In this study, we have investigated whether epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) play a role in DENV acquisition and dissemination. We have used a human epidermal ex vivo infection model as well as isolated LCs to investigate infection by DENV. Notably, both immature and mature LCs were permissive to DENV infection in vitro and ex vivo, and infection was dependent on C-type lectin receptor langerin because blocking antibodies against langerin significantly reduced DENV infection in vitro and ex vivo. DENV-infected LCs efficiently transmitted DENV to target cells such as dendritic cells. Moreover, DENV exposure increased the migration of LCs from epidermal explants. These results strongly suggest that DENV targets epidermal LCs for infection and dissemination in the human host.

Virus strain and host immune response have been implicated as the risk factors for hemorrhage development. To delineate the complex interplay between the virus and the host, we established a dengue hemorrhage model in immune-competent mice. Mice inoculated intradermally with dengue virus develop hemorrhage within 3 days. In the present study, we showed by the presence of NS1 antigen and viral nuclei acid that dengue virus actively infects the endothelium at 12 h and 24 h after inoculation. Temporal studies showed that beginning at day 2, there was macrophage infiltration into the vicinity of the endothelium, increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production, and endothelial cell apoptosis in the tissues. In the meantime, endothelial cells in the hemorrhage tissues expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine. In vitro studies showed that primary mouse and human endothelial cells were productively infected by dengue virus. Infection by dengue virus induced endothelial cell production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species and apoptotic cell death, which was greatly enhanced by TNF-alpha. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and N-acetyl cysteine reversed the effects of dengue virus and TNF-alpha on endothelial cells. Importantly, hemorrhage development and the severity of hemorrhage were greatly reduced in mice lacking iNOS or p47(phox) or treatment with oxidase inhibitor, pointing to the critical roles of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species in dengue hemorrhage."""

One example is Zika virus (ZIKV), an RNA virus that has reemerged in recent years. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV efficiently infects fibroblasts from humans, great apes, New and Old World monkeys, but not rodents. ZIKV infection in human-but not murine-cells impairs responses to agonists of the cGMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN genes (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway, suggesting that viral mechanisms to evade antiviral defenses are less effective in rodent cells. Indeed, human, but not mouse, STING is subject to cleavage by proteases encoded by ZIKV, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, but not that of yellow fever virus. The protease cleavage site, located between positions 78/79 of human STING, is only partially conserved in nonhuman primates and rodents, rendering these orthologs resistant to degradation. Genetic disruption of STING increases the susceptibility of mouse-but not human-cells to ZIKV. Accordingly, expression of only mouse, not human, STING in murine STING knockout cells rescues the ZIKV suppression phenotype. STING-deficient mice, however, did not exhibit increased susceptibility, suggesting that other redundant antiviral pathways control ZIKV infection in vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrate that numerous RNA viruses evade cGAS/STING-dependent signaling and affirm the importance of this pathway in shaping the host range of ZIKV. Furthermore, our results explain-at least in part-the decreased permissivity of rodent cells to ZIKV, which could aid in the development of mice model with inheritable susceptibility to ZIKV and other flaviviruses."""

Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was used to perform a comparative proteomic analysis between the midgut ofAe. albopictusinfected with DENV and the control. 3,419 proteins were detected, of which 162 were ≥ 1.2-fold differentially upregulated or ≤ 0.8-fold differentially downregulated (p< 0.05) during DENV infections.

We found that one of the DEPs, a putative pupal cuticle (PC) protein could inhibit the replication of DENV and interact with the DENV-E protein. In addition, the result of immunofluorescence (IF) test showed that there was co-localization between ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) protein and the DENV-E protein, and virus infection reduced the level of this protein. iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of theAe. albopictusmidgut identified dengue infection-induced upregulated and downregulated proteins.

A 99-nucleotide, uridine-rich hairpin 5'pppRNA termed M8 stimulated an extensive and robust interferon response compared to other modified 5'pppRNA structures, RIG-I aptamers, or poly(I·C). Interestingly, manipulation of the primary RNA sequence alone was sufficient to modulate antiviral activity and inflammatory response, in a manner dependent exclusively on RIG-I and independent of MDA5 and TLR3. Both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of M8 effectively inhibited influenza virus and dengue virus replication in vitro. Furthermore, multiple strains of influenza virus that were resistant to oseltamivir, an FDA-approved therapeutic treatment for influenza, were highly sensitive to inhibition by M8. Finally, prophylactic M8 treatment in vivo prolonged survival and reduced lung viral titers of mice challenged with influenza virus, as well as reducing chikungunya virus-associated foot swelling and viral load.

Ten markers (sHLA-G, IL-10, IL-22, IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, HGF, VEGF, and IL-1RA) exhibited differential levels between the acute and recovery phases, with pronounced increases in MIP-1α (P<0.0001), MCP-1 (P<0.0001), HGF (P= 0.0001), and VEGF (P<0.0001) in the acute phase.

Soluble serum (IL-22, RANTES, Eotaxin) and CSF (IL-8, EGF, IL-3) mediators may discriminate putative risks for neurological complications following arbovirus infections. Neurological complications were associated with the presence of a predominant inflammatory profile, whereas in non-complicated patients an anti-inflammatory profile may predominate. Mediators associated with neuroregeneration (EGF and IL-3) may be induced in response to neurological damage. Broad spectrum immune checkpoint molecules (sHLA-G) interact with cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors.

Dengue infection triggers host production of the type 1 IFN, IFN alpha, one of the strongest and broadest acting antivirals known. However, dengue virus subverts host IFN signaling at early steps of IFN signal transduction. This subversion allows unbridled viral replication which subsequently triggers ongoing production of IFN which, again, is subverted. Identification of downstream IFN antiviral effectors will provide targets which could be activated to restore broad acting antiviral activity, stopping the signal to produce endogenous IFN at toxic levels. To this end, we performed a targeted functional genomic screen for IFN antiviral effector genes (IEGs), identifying 56 IEGs required for antiviral effects of IFN against fully infectious dengue virus. Dengue IEGs were enriched for genes encoding nuclear receptor interacting proteins, including HELZ2, MAP2K4, SLC27A2, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1. We focused on HELZ2 (Helicase With Zinc Finger 2), an IFN stimulated gene and IEG which encodes a promiscuous nuclear factor coactivator that exists in two isoforms. The two unique HELZ2 isoforms are both IFN responsive, contain ISRE elements, and gene products increase in the nucleus upon IFN stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed that the HELZ2 complex interacts with triglyceride-regulator LMF1. Mass spectrometry revealed that HELZ2 knockdown cells are depleted of triglyceride subsets. We thus sought to determine whether HELZ2 interacts with a nuclear receptor known to regulate immune response and lipid metabolism, AHR, and identified HELZ2:AHR interactions via co-immunoprecipitation, found that AHR is a dengue IEG, and that an AHR ligand, FICZ, exhibits anti-dengue activity. Primary bone marrow derived macrophages from HELZ2 knockout mice, compared to wild type controls, exhibit enhanced dengue infectivity. Overall, these findings reveal that IFN antiviral response is mediated by HELZ2 transcriptional upregulation, enrichment of HELZ2 protein levels in the nucleus, and activation of a transcriptional program that appears to modulate intracellular lipid state. IEGs identified in this study may serve as both (1) potential targets for host directed antiviral design, downstream of the common flaviviral subversion point, as well as (2) possible biomarkers, whose variation, natural, or iatrogenic, could affect host response to viral infections."""

Signaling by each is initiated by the recognition of viral products such as RNA and occurs through downstream interaction with the IPS-1 adaptor protein. We directly compared the innate immune signaling requirements of representative viruses of the Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Reoviridae for RIG-I, MDA5, and interferon promoter-stimulating factor 1 (IPS-1). In cultured fibroblasts, IPS-1 was essential for innate immune signaling of downstream interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and interferon-stimulated gene expression, but the requirements for RIG-I and MDA5 were variable. Each was individually dispensable for signaling triggered by reovirus and dengue virus, whereas RIG-I was essential for signaling by influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus. Functional genomics analyses identified cellular genes triggered during influenza A virus infection whose expression was strictly dependent on RIG-I and which are involved in processes of innate or adaptive immunity, apoptosis, cytokine signaling, and inflammation associated with the host response to contemporary and pandemic strains of influenza virus. These results define IPS-1-dependent signaling as an essential feature of host immunity to RNA virus infection. Our observations further demonstrate differential and redundant roles for RIG-I and MDA5 in pathogen recognition and innate immune signaling that may reflect unique and shared biologic properties of RNA viruses whose differential triggering and control of gene expression may impact pathogenesis and infection."""

GBV-C infection and expression of the GBV-C nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and the DV NS5 protein in CD4(+) T cells inhibit HIV replication in vitro. To determine whether the inhibitory effect on HIV replication is conserved among other flaviviruses and to characterize mechanism(s) of HIV inhibition, the NS5 proteins of GBV-C, DV, hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus (YFV; vaccine strain 17D) were expressed in CD4(+) T cells. All NS5 proteins inhibited HIV replication. This correlated with decreased steady-state CD4 mRNA levels and reduced cell surface CD4 protein expression. Infection of CD4(+) T cells and macrophages with YFV (17D vaccine strain) also inhibited HIV replication and decreased CD4 gene expression. In contrast, mumps virus was not inhibited by the expression of flavivirus NS5 protein or by YFV infection, and mumps infection did not alter CD4 mRNA or protein levels. In summary, CD4 gene expression is decreased by all human flavivirus NS5 proteins studied.

Non-invasive imaging biomarkers are potentially valuable tools for studying viral pathogenesis, prognosticating host response to disease, and evaluating in vivo efficacy of experimental therapeutic interventions. In this study, we evaluated [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging biomarker of ZIKV disease in a mouse model and correlated metabolic tracer tissue uptake with real-time biochemical, virological, and inflammatory features of tissue infection.Methods:[18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging was performed in an acute, lethal ZIKV mouse infection model, at increasing stages of disease severity. [18F]FDG-PET findings were corroborated with ex vivo wholemount-tissue autoradiography and tracer biodistribution studies. Tracer uptake was also correlated with in situ tissue disease status, including viral burden and inflammatory response. Immune profiling of the spleen by flow cytometry was performed to identify the immune cell subsets driving tissue pathology and enhancing tracer uptake in ZIKV disease.Results:Foci of increased [18F]FDG uptake were consistently detected in lymphoid tissues-particularly the spleen-of ZIKV-infected animals. Splenic uptake increased with disease severity, and corroborated findings in tissue pathology. Increased splenic uptake also correlated with increased viral replication and elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines within these tissues. ZIKV-infected spleens were characterized by increased infiltration of myeloid cells, as well as increased proliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. The increased cell proliferation correlated with increased tracer uptake in the spleen. Our findings support the use of [18F]FDG as an imaging biomarker to detect and track ZIKV disease in real time and highlight the dependency of affected tissue on the nature of the viral infection.Conclusion:[18F]FDG uptake in the spleen is a useful surrogate for interrogating in situ tissue viral burden and inflammation status in this ZIKV murine model."""

During transmission of most vector-borne diseases, the pathogen is delivered to the vertebrate host along with the arthropod saliva during blood feeding and previous studies have shown the existence of IgG4 antibodies against mosquito salivary allergens. However, there is very little ongoing research or information available regarding IgG4 bi-specificity with regard to infectious disease, particularly during immune responses to vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, filariasis, or dengue virus infection.

In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that this RNA-binding nuclease also targets viral RNA and possesses potent antiviral activities. Overexpression of the human MCPIP1, but not MCPIP2, MCPIP3 or MCPIP4, inhibited Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DEN) replication. The functional analysis of MCPIP1 revealed that the activities of RNase, RNA binding and oligomerization, but not deubiqutinase, are required for its antiviral potential. Furthermore, infection of other positive-sense RNA viruses, such as sindbis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus, and negative-sense RNA virus, such as influenza virus, as well as DNA virus, such as adenovirus, can also be blocked by MCPIP1. Moreover, the endogenous MCPIP1 gene expression was induced by JEV and DEN infection, and knockdown of MCPIP1 expression enhanced the replication of JEV and DEN in human cells. Thus, MCPIP1 can act as a host innate defense via RNase activity for targeting and degrading viral RNA."""

In endemic regions, the population is regularly bitten by naive vectors, implicating a permanent stimulation of the immune system by the vector saliva itself (pre-immune context). Comparatively, the number of bites received by exposed individuals from non-infected vectors is much higher than the bites from infected ones. Therefore, vector saliva and the immunological response in the skin may play an important role, so far underestimated, in the establishment of anti-pathogen immunity in endemic areas. Hence, the parasite biology and the disease pathogenesis in """"saliva-primed"""" and """"saliva-unprimed"""" individuals must be different. This integrated view on how the pathogen evolves within the host together with vector salivary components, which are known to be endowed with a variety of pharmacological and immunological properties, must remain the focus of any investigational study dealing with vector-borne diseases. Considering this three-way partnership, the host skin (immune system), the pathogen, and the vector saliva, the approach that consists in the validation of vector saliva as a source of molecular entities with anti-disease vaccine potential has been recently a subject of active and fruitful investigation. As an example, the vaccination with maxadilan, a potent vasodilator peptide extracted from the saliva of the sand flyLutzomyia longipalpis, was able to protect against infection with various leishmanial parasites. More interestingly, a universal mosquito saliva vaccine that may potentially protect against a range of mosquito-borne infections including malaria, dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. In this review, we highlight the key role played by the immunobiology of vector saliva in shaping the outcome of vector-borne diseases and discuss the value of studying diseases in the light of intimate cross talk among the pathogen, the vector saliva, and the host immune mechanisms."""

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DENV) are globally emerging pathogens that lead to epidemics and outbreaks with continued transmission to newer geographical areas over time. In the past decade, studies have focussed on understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of these viruses in a bid to alleviate their disease burden. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNAs that have emerged as master-regulators of cellular gene expression. The dynamics of miRNAs within a cell have the capacity to modulate hundreds of genes and, consequently, their physiological manifestation. Increasing evidence suggests their role in host response to disease and infection including cell survival, intracellular viral replication and immune activation. In this review, we aim to comprehensively update published evidence on the role of miRNAs in host cells infected with the common neurotropic flaviviruses, with an increased focus on neuropathogenic mechanisms.

WHO estimated 100-400 million infections each year and reported 4.2 million active cases in 2019 worldwide. The infection is caused by arthropod-transmitted dengue virus which is known to have 5 serotypes (DENV1-5). Most of the cases show mild clinical symptoms; though others may develop severe forms viz; dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Though limited literature suggests the population-specific genetic influence on susceptibility and the clinical course of dengue; the genetic propensity of dengue is largely unknown in most ethnicities. In this context, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system represents the most polymorphic region of the human genome and is crucial for the initiation of an appropriate immune response. In most of the genome-wide association studies, the HLA complex is the most significantly linked genetic region with susceptibility or protection towards various infectious and noninfectious diseases. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors represent another highly variable system present on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells which regulate the activity of NK cells through interactions with their cognate HLA ligands. It is conceivable that the interaction of HLA-Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors systems influences the host susceptibility towards dengue infection as well the disease outcome. Here we attempt to review these parameters in dengue infection and disease outcome. Further detailed investigations are warranted towards the identification of novel susceptibility markers and targeted therapeutic interventions."""

Here, we provided the first transcriptional profile of HERVs in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) infected A549 cells by using high-throughput RNA sequencing. The results showed that a number of HERVs and human genes were significantly differentially expressed in response to DENV-2 infection. Further bioinformatic analyses indicated a correlation between HERVs and human genes. In particular, the genes near the HERVs activated by dengue infection were dominantly enriched in the antiviral immune response.

It is an Aedes-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue virus, which has four serotypes. Each serotype acts as an independent infectious agent. The antibodies against one serotype confer homotypic immunity but temporary protection against heterotypic infection. Dengue has become a growing health concern for up to one third of the world's population. Currently, there is no potent anti-dengue medicine, and treatment for severe dengue relies on intravenous fluid management and pain medications. The burden of dengue dramatically increases despite advances in vector control measures. These factors underscore the need for a vaccine. Various dengue vaccine strategies have been demonstrated, that is, live attenuated vaccine, inactivated vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, and viral-vector vaccines, some of which are at the stage of clinical testing. Unfortunately, the forefront candidate vaccine is less than satisfactory, and its performance depends on serostatus and age factors. The lessons from clinical studies depicted ambiguity concerning the efficacy of dengue vaccine. Our study highlighted that viral structural heterogeneity, epitope accessibility, autoimmune complications, genetic variants, genetic diversities, antigen competition, virulence variation, host-pathogen specific interaction, antibody-dependent enhancement, cross-reactive immunity among Flaviviruses, and host-susceptibility determinants not only influence infection outcomes but also hampered successful vaccine development.

However, the mechanism underlying the functional role of autophagy in the viral life cycle still remains unclear. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense, membrane-enveloped RNA virus that can cause chronic liver disease. Here we report that HCV induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), which in turn activates the autophagic pathway to promote HCV RNA replication in human hepatoma cells. Further analysis revealed that the entire autophagic process through to complete autolysosome maturation was required to promote HCV RNA replication and that it did so by suppressing innate antiviral immunity. Gene silencing or activation of the UPR-autophagy pathway activated or repressed, respectively, IFN-β activation mediated by an HCV-derived pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Similar results were achieved with a PAMP derived from Dengue virus (DEV), indicating that HCV and DEV may both exploit the UPR-autophagy pathway to escape the innate immune response. Taken together, these results not only define the physiological significance of HCV-induced autophagy, but also shed light on the knowledge of host cellular responses upon HCV infection as well as on exploration of therapeutic targets for controlling HCV infection."""

Currently, preventive measures are falling short to control epidemics and there are no antivirals against any Flavivirus.Flaviviruses carry a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that plays multiple roles in infected cells: it is translated into viral proteins, used as template for genome replication, it is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA and it is assembled into new virions. Furthermore, viral RNA genomes are also packaged into extracellular vesicles, e.g. exosomes, which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination.Because RNA molecules are at the center of Flavivirus replication cycle, viral and host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical determinants of infection. Numerous studies have revealed the function of RBPs during Flavivirus infection, particularly at the level of RNA translation and replication. These proteins, however, are also critical participants at the late stages of the replication cycle. Here we revise the function of host RBPs and the viral proteins capsid, NS2A and NS3, during the packaging of viral RNA and the assembly of new virus particles. Furthermore, we go through the evidence pointing towards the importance of host RBPs in mediating cellular RNA export with the idea that the biogenesis of exosomes harboring Flavivirus RNA would follow an analogous pathway."""

ZIKA induced an RNAi response in the mosquito with virus-derived short interfering RNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs dramatically increased in abundance post-infection. Further, we found 17 host microRNAs (miRNAs) that were modulated by ZIKV infection at all time points. Strikingly, many of these regulated miRNAs have been reported to have their expression altered by dengue and West Nile viruses, while the response was divergent from that induced by the alphavirus Chikungunya virus in mosquitoes. This suggests that conserved miRNA responses occur within mosquitoes in response to flavivirus infection.

Current treatments are limited to early administration of antibiotics and supportive care. While appealing, the strategy of targeted inhibition of individual molecules in the inflammatory cascade has not proved beneficial. Non-targeted, systemic immunosuppression with steroids has shown limited efficacy and raises concern for secondary infection. Iminosugars are a class of small molecule glycomimetics with distinct inhibition profiles for glycan processing enzymes based on stereochemistry. Inhibition of host endoplasmic reticulum resident glycoprotein processing enzymes has demonstrated efficacy as a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy, but limited consideration has been given to the effects on host glycoprotein production and consequent disruption of signalling cascades. This work demonstrates that iminosugars inhibit dengue virus, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and fungal antigen-stimulated cytokine responses in human macrophages. In spite of decreased inflammatory mediator production, viral replication is suppressed in the presence of iminosugar. Transcriptome analysis reveals the key interaction of pathogen-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, the resulting unfolded protein response and inflammation.

Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic on all continents except Antarctica, and it is estimated that more than 100 million people are infected each year. Herein, we further mine the data from a previously described screen for microRNAs (miRNAs) that block flavivirus replication. We use miR-424, a member of the miR-15/16 family, as a tool to further dissect the role of host cell proteins during DENV infection. We observed that miR-424 suppresses expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1, which is normally induced during dengue virus 2 (DENV2) infection through activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIAH1 also results in inhibition of DENV replication, demonstrating that this target is at least partly responsible for the antiviral activity of miR-424. We further show that SIAH1 binds to and ubiquitinates the innate immune adaptor protein MyD88 and that the antiviral effect of SIAH1 knockdown is reduced in cells in which MyD88 has been deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Additionally, MyD88-dependent signaling, triggered either by DENV2 infection or the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) ligand imiquimod, is increased in cells in which SIAH1 has been knocked down by miR-424 or a SIAH1-specific siRNA. These observations suggest an additional pathway by which DENV2 harnesses aspects of the UPR to dampen the host innate immune response and promote viral replication."""

There are many gaps in knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of leptospirosis and the role of host immunity in causing symptoms. This hinders essential steps in combating disease, such as developing a potential vaccine. Another major problem with leptospirosis is the lack of an easy to perform, accurate diagnostic tests. Many clinicians in resource limited settings resort to clinical judgment in diagnosing leptospirosis. This is unfortunate, as many other diseases such as dengue, hanta virus, rickettsial infections, and even severe bacterial sepsis, can mimic leptospirosis. Another interesting problem is the prediction of disease severity at the onset of the illness. The majority of patients recover from leptospirosis with only a mild febrile illness, while a few others have severe illness with multi-organ failure. Clinical features are poor predictors of potential severity of infection, and therefore the search is on for potential biomarkers that can serve as early warnings for severe disease.

In light of this we established a HepAD38-derived reporter cell line that expresses firefly luciferase in response to the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway for high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecular human STING agonists. This cell-based reporter assay required only 4 h treatment with a reference STING agonist to induce a robust luciferase signal and was demonstrated to have an excellent performance in HTS format. By screening 16,000 compounds, a dispiro diketopiperzine (DSDP) compound was identified to induce cytokine response in a manner dependent on the expression of functional human STING, but not mouse STING. Moreover, we showed that DSDP induced an interferon-dominant cytokine response in human skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which in turn potently suppressed the replication of yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Zika virus. We have thus established a robust cell-based assay system suitable for rapid discovery and mechanistic analyses of cGAS-STING pathway agonists.

The unusual pathologies induced by ZIKV infection and the knowledge that the flaviviral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), the most conserved protein in the flavivirus proteome, can modulate the host immune response during ZIKV infection prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of NS5 during ZIKV infection and explore its functional significance. A monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence within ZIKV NS5 was predicted by the cNLS Mapper program, and we observed localization of ZIKV NS5 in the nucleus of infected cells by immunostaining with specific antibodies. Strikingly, ZIKV NS5 forms spherical shell-like nuclear bodies that exclude DNA. The putative monopartite NLS390KRPR393is necessary to direct FLAG-tagged NS5 to the nucleus as the NS5390ARPA393mutant protein accumulates in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, coimmunostaining experiments reveal that NS5 localizes with and sequesters importin-α, but not importin-β, in the observed nuclear bodies during virus infection. Structural and biochemical data demonstrate binding of ZIKV NS5 with importin-α and reveal important binding determinants required for their interaction and formation of complexes that give rise to the supramolecular nuclear bodies. Significantly, we demonstrate a neuronal-specific activation of the host immune response to ZIKV infection and a possible role of ZIKV NS5's nuclear localization toward this activation.

However, not all epidemic cycles are from pathogens inducing sterilizing immunity or are driven by demographics. Many sexually transmitted infections are driven by sexual behaviour. We present a mathematical model of disease transmission where individuals can disconnect and reconnect depending on the infectious status of their contacts. We fit the model to historic syphilis (Treponema pallidum) and gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) incidence in the USA and explore potential intervention strategies against syphilis. We find that cycles in syphilis incidence can be driven solely by changing sexual behaviour in structured populations. Our model also explains the lack of similar cycles in gonorrhea incidence even if the two infections share the same propagation pathways. Our model similarly illustrates how sudden epidemic outbreaks can occur on time scales smaller than the characteristic demographic time scale of the population and that weaker infections can lead to more violent outbreaks. Behaviour also appears to be critical for control strategies as we found a bigger sensitivity to behavioural interventions than antibiotic treatment. Thus, behavioural interventions may play a larger role than previously thought, especially in the face of antibiotic resistance and low intervention efficacies."""

Abx treatment impaired the development of optimal T cell responses, with decreased levels of WNV-specific CD8+T cells associated with increased infection and immunopathology. Abx treatments that resulted in enhanced WNV susceptibility generated changes in the overall structure of the gut bacterial community and in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa.

However, the long-term establishment of wMel in natural Ae. aegypti populations raises concerns that interactions between Wolbachia wMel and Ae. aegypti may lead to changes in the host genome, which could affect useful attributes of Wolbachia that allow it to invade and suppress disease transmission.Results:We applied an evolve-and-resequence approach to study genome-wide genetic changes in Ae. aegypti from the Cairns region, Australia, where Wolbachia wMel was first introduced more than 10 years ago. Mosquito samples were collected at three different time points in Gordonvale, Australia, covering the phase before (2010) and after (2013 and 2018) Wolbachia releases. An additional three locations where Wolbachia replacement happened at different times across the last decade were also sampled in 2018. We found that the genomes of mosquito populations mostly remained stable after Wolbachia release, with population differences tending to reflect the geographic location of the populations rather than Wolbachia infection status. However, outlier analysis suggests that Wolbachia may have had an influence on some genes related to immune response, development, recognition and behavior.Conclusions:Ae. aegypti populations remained geographically distinct after Wolbachia wMel releases in North Australia despite their Wolbachia infection status. At some specific genomic loci, we found signs of selection associated with Wolbachia, suggesting potential evolutionary impacts can happen in the future and further monitoring is warranted."""

Although RNA viruses replicate in the infected host cell cytoplasm, the nucleus is central to key stages of the infectious cycle of HIV-1 and influenza, and an important target of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) in limiting the host antiviral response. We previously identified the small molecule ivermectin as an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase nuclear entry, subsequently showing ivermectin could inhibit DENV NS5 nuclear import, as well as limit infection by viruses such as HIV-1 and DENV. We show here that ivermectin's broad spectrum antiviral activity relates to its ability to target the host importin (IMP) α/β1 nuclear transport proteins responsible for nuclear entry of cargoes such as integrase and NS5. We establish for the first time that ivermectin can dissociate the preformed IMPα/β1 heterodimer, as well as prevent its formation, through binding to the IMPα armadillo (ARM) repeat domain to impact IMPα thermal stability and α-helicity. We show that ivermectin inhibits NS5-IMPα interaction in a cell context using quantitative bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Finally, we show for the first time that ivermectin can limit infection by the DENV-related West Nile virus at low (μM) concentrations. Since it is FDA approved for parasitic indications, ivermectin merits closer consideration as a broad spectrum antiviral of interest."""

Despite plans for its widespread use in Aedes aegypti, Wolbachia's mode of action remains poorly understood. Many studies suggest that the mechanism is likely multifaceted, involving aspects of immunity, cellular stress and nutritional competition. A previous study from our group used artificial selection to identify a new mosquito candidate gene related to viral blocking; alpha-mannosidase-2a (alpha-Mann-2a) with a predicted role in protein glycosylation. Protein glycosylation pathways tend to be involved in complex host-viral interactions; however, the function of alpha-mannosidases has not been described in mosquito-virus interactions. We examined alpha-Mann-2a expression in response to virus and Wolbachia infections and whether reduced gene expression, caused by RNA interference, affected viral loads. We show that dengue virus (DENV) infection affects the expression of alpha-Mann-2a in a tissue- and time-dependent manner, whereas Wolbachia infection had no effect. In the midgut, DENV prevalence increased following knockdown of alpha-Mann-2a expression in Wolbachia-free mosquitoes, suggesting that alpha-Mann-2a interferes with infection. Expression knockdown had the same effect on the togavirus chikungunya virus, indicating that alpha-Mann-2a may have broad antivirus effects in the midgut. Interestingly, we were unable to knockdown the expression in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. We also provide evidence that alpha-Mann-2a may affect the transcriptional level of another gene predicted to be involved in viral blocking and cell adhesion; cadherin87a. These data support the hypothesis that glycosylation and adhesion pathways may broadly be involved in viral infection in Ae. aegypti."""

Due to the temporal and geographical co-circulation of flaviviruses in Europe, flavivirus differentiation by diagnostic tests is crucial in the adaptation of surveillance and control efforts. Serological diagnosis of flavivirus infections is complicated by the antigenic similarities among the Flavivirus genus. Indeed, most flavivirus antibodies are directed against the highly immunogenic envelope protein, which contains both flavivirus cross-reactive and virus-specific epitopes. Serological assay results should thus be interpreted with care and confirmed by comparative neutralization tests using a panel of viruses known to circulate in Europe. However, antibody cross-reactivity could be advantageous in efforts to control emerging flaviviruses because it ensures partial cross-protection. In contrast, it might also facilitate subsequent diseases, through a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement mainly described for dengue virus infections. Here, we review the serological methods commonly used in WNV diagnosis and surveillance in Europe. By examining past and current epidemiological situations in different European countries, we present the challenges involved in interpreting flavivirus serological tests and setting up appropriate surveillance programs; we also address the consequences of flavivirus circulation and vaccination for host immunity."""

Microarray-based transcriptome analysis among treatments indicated a total of 4725 transcripts with differential expression between the two strains. Eleven genes were selected from different functional groups based on their significant up or down expression levels as well as reports in the literature suggesting they are associated with dengue virus elimination.

We found that labyrinthopeptins A1 and A2, the prototype congeners of carbacyclic lanthipeptides, inhibit the proliferation of diverse enveloped viruses, including dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, chikungunya virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus, in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. Mechanistic studies on viral particles revealed that labyrinthopeptins induce a virolytic effect through binding to the viral membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). These effects are enhanced by a combined equimolar application of both labyrinthopeptins, and a clear synergism was observed across a concentration range corresponding to 10% to 90% inhibitory concentrations of the compounds. Time-resolved experiments with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) reveal that membrane lipid raft compositions (phosphatidylcholine [PC]/PE/cholesterol/sphingomyelin at 17:10:33:40) are particularly sensitive to labyrinthopeptins in comparison to PC/PE (90:10) LUVs, even though the overall PE amount remains constant. Labyrinthopeptins exhibited low cytotoxicity and had favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mice (half-life [t1/2] = 10.0 h), which designates them promising antiviral compounds acting by an unusual viral lipid targeting mechanism.IMPORTANCEFor many viral infections, current treatment options are insufficient. Because the development of each antiviral drug is time-consuming and expensive, the prospect of finding broad-spectrum antivirals that can fight multiple, diverse viruses-well-known viruses as well as (re)emerging species-has gained attention, especially for the treatment of viral coinfections. While most known broad-spectrum agents address processes in the host cell, we found that targeting lipids of the free virus outside the host cell with the natural products labyrinthopeptin A1 and A2 is a viable strategy to inhibit the proliferation of a broad range of viruses from different families, including chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and cytomegalovirus. Labyrinthopeptins bind to viral phosphatidylethanolamine and induce virolysis without exerting cytotoxicity on host cells.

This phenomenon is not surprising since both the innate immunity and the hemostatic systems are two ancestral mechanisms which closely cooperate favoring host's defense against foreign invaders. However, the excessive response of these systems may be dangerous for the host itself.Materials and methods:We searched and retrieved the articles, using the following electronic database: MedLine and Embase. We limited our search to articles published in English, but no restrictions in terms of article type, publication year, and geography were adopted.Results:The hemostatic phenotype of the infectious diseases is variable depending on the points of attack of the different involved pathogens. Infectious diseases which show a prothrombotic phenotype are bacterial sepsis, SARS-CoV-2 and malaria. However, among the bacterial sepsis, Yersinia Pestis is characterized by a profibrinolytic behavior. On the contrary, the hemorrhagic fevers, due to Dengue and Ebola virus, mainly exploit the activation of fibrinolysis secondary to a huge endothelial damage which can release a large amount of t-PA in the early phase of the diseases.Conclusions:Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis are greatly activated based on the strategy of the different infectious agents which exploit the excess of response of both systems to achieve the greatest possible virulence."""

The control of DENV infection has not yet been fully successful due to lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the immune responses against DENV infection may reveal new strategies for eliciting and improving antiviral immunity. T cells provide protective immunity against various viral infections by generating effector cells that cooperate to eliminate antigens and memory cells that can survive for long periods with enhanced abilities to control recurring pathogens. Following activation, CD8 T cells can migrate to sites of infection and kill infected cells, whereas CD4 T cells contribute to the elimination of pathogens by trafficking to infected tissues and providing help to innate immune responses, B cells, as well as CD8 T cells. However, it is now evident that CD4 T cells can also perform cytotoxic functions and induce the apoptosis of target cells. Importantly, accumulating studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD4 T cells develop following DENV infections and may play a crucial role in protecting the host from severe dengue disease.

In this study, we identified the human target proteins which interact with WNV based on protein structure similarity, and then the interacting pairs were filtered by the subcellular co-localization information. As a result, a network of 3346 interactions was constructed, involving 6 WNV proteins and 1970 human target proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first predicted interactome for WNV-human. By analyzing the topological properties and evolutionary rates of the human target proteins, it was demonstrated that these proteins tend to be the hub and bottleneck proteins in the human PPI network and are more conserved than the non-target ones. Triplet analysis showed that the target proteins are adjacent to each other in the human PPI network, suggesting that these proteins may have similar biological functions. Further, the functional enrichment analysis indicated that the target proteins are mainly involved in virus process, transcription regulation, cell adhesion, and so on.

Here, we have developed a novel scalable chemiluminescence-based assay for assessing SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect to quantify the neutralizing activity of antisera. The assay leverages the correlation between host cell viability and ATP levels in culture to measure the cytopathic effect on target cells induced by clinically isolated, replication-competent, authentic SARS-CoV-2.

To trace down if viral-miRNAs targeted the genes critical to the immune pathway, we assessed whether mature miRNA transcripts exhibit effective hybridization with the 3'UTR region of human gene transcripts. Conversely, we also tried to study human miRNA-mediated viral gene regulation to get insight into the miRNA mediated offense and defense mechanism of virus and its host organisms in toto.Results:Our analysis led us to shortlist six putative miRNAs that target, majorly, genes related to cell proliferation/ differentiation/signaling, and senescence.

The re-localization of RBPs to the nucleus coincides with global alterations to RNA processing in the nucleus. While affecting many host mRNAs, these alterations are pronounced in mRNAs encoding type I and type III interferons and correlate with their retention in the nucleus and reduction in interferon protein production. Similar RNA processing defects also occur during infection with either dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2 when RNase L is activated.

Evidently, a cellular RNA helicase, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and a cellular kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), are required for flavivirus-induced IRF-3 and NF-kappaB activation, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that JEV and DEN-2 initiate the host innate immune response through a molecular mechanism involving RIG-I/IRF-3 and PI3K/NF-kappaB signaling pathways."""

The activity of vitamin D is associated with microRNAs, which are fine tuners of immune activation pathways and provide novel mechanisms to avoid the damage that arises from excessive inflammatory responses. Severe symptoms of an ongoing dengue virus infection and disease are strongly related to highly altered production of proinflammatory mediators, suggesting impairment in homeostatic mechanisms that control the host's immune response. Here, we discuss the possible implications of emerging studies anticipating the biological effects of vitamin D and microRNAs during the inflammatory response, and we attempt to extrapolate these findings to dengue virus infection and to their potential use for disease management strategies."""

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed in eight individuals with detectable viral RNA and compared to five healthy subjects. A total of 106 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 19 miRNAs were either fivefold prominently up- or down-regulation. Several miRNAs associated with cytokine expression, some of which were previously associated with Dengue and Hantavirus infections were revealed. Moreover, possible mechanisms related to secretion of adhesion molecules and viral escape from innate immunity were identified.

Our vaccine candidate is expected to mimic natural dengue virus infection, as it provides all the components of dengue virus, including both structural and nonstructural proteins. Therefore, induction of more solid and comprehensive immune responses against pathogenic dengue viruses is also expected. In this study, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody responses for each serotype induced by a single subcutaneous administration of 6 formulations, which were composed of different combinations of vaccine strains and were all of different dosages. These formulations were tested in dengue-naïve cynomolgus macaques. As a result, regardless of the TDV formulation, all the monkeys immunized with TDVs seroconverted to all the 4 serotypes at day 30. Next, we evaluated protection ability of the selected formulations of TDV candidate, no RNAemia was detected from any of the immunized monkeys upon s.c. challenge with wtDENV.

The virus causes the development of the disease Japanese encephalitis (JE) in a small proportion of those infected, predominantly affecting children in eastern and southern Asia. Annual JE incidence estimates range from 50,000-175,000, with 25%-30% of cases resulting in mortality. It is estimated that 3 billion people live in countries in which JEV is endemic. The virus exists in an enzootic transmission cycle, with mosquitoes transmitting JEV between birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifying hosts. Zoonotic infection occurs as a result of spillover events from the main transmission cycle. The reservoir avian hosts include cattle egrets, pond herons, and other species of water birds belonging to the family Ardeidae. Irrigated rice fields provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and attract migratory birds, maintaining the transmission of JEV. Although multiple vaccines have been developed for JEV, they are expensive and require multiple doses to maintain efficacy and immunity. As humans are a """"dead-end"""" host for the virus, vaccination of the human population is unlikely to result in eradication. Therefore, vector control of the principal mosquito vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, represents a more promising strategy for reducing transmission. Current vector control strategies include intermittent irrigation of rice fields and space spraying of insecticides during outbreaks. However, Cx. Tritaeniorhynchus is subject to heavy exposure to pesticides in rice fields, and as a result, insecticide resistance has developed. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the potential use of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia for mosquito biocontrol. The successful transinfection of Wolbachia strains from Drosophila flies to Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes has resulted in the generation of """"dengue-refractory"""" mosquito lines. The successful establishment of Wolbachia in wild Aedes aegypti populations has recently been demonstrated, and open releases in dengue-endemic countries are ongoing. This review outlines the current control methods for JEV in addition to highlighting the potential use of Wolbachia-based biocontrol strategies to impact transmission.

Immunogenic and highly conserved properties of Non-Structural Protein 5(NS5) in DENV makes it a potent marker to identify DENV infection. DENV interfere in the innate immune signaling and thereby decreases antiviral responses and favors viral replication. Viral recognition by host pathogen recognition receptors facilitates binding of interferon (IFN) to the interferon receptors that further activates both the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-2 (STAT-2) a factor producing an antiviral response. The most debilitating factor of DENV infection is emaciation of human immune system by DENV- NS5. NS5 counters the antiviral response by STAT2 degradation impeding the transcriptional activation of interferon stimulated genes through interferon stimulated response elements. The present study aims to identify inhibitors for NS5 Methyl Transferase (MTase) domain and to provide an insight into the mechanism of STAT2 degradation in the host infected with DENV.

Many possible viral genetic determinants of the intrinsic virulence of dengue virus (DENV) in the host have been identified, but no conclusive evidence of a correlation between viral genotype and virus transmissibility and pathogenicity has been obtained.Methodology/principal findings:We used reverse genetics techniques to engineer DENV-1 viruses with subsets of mutations found in two different neuroadapted derivatives. The mutations were inserted into an infectious clone of DENV-1 not adapted to mice. The replication and viral production capacity of the recombinant viruses were assessed in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that paired mutations in the envelope protein (E) and in the helicase domain of the NS3 (NS3(hel)) protein had a synergistic effect enhancing viral fitness in human and mosquito derived cell lines. E mutations alone generated no detectable virulence in the mouse model; however, the combination of these mutations with NS3(hel) mutations, which were mildly virulent on their own, resulted in a highly neurovirulent phenotype.Conclusions/significance:The generation of recombinant viruses carrying specific E and NS3(hel) proteins mutations increased viral fitness both in vitro and in vivo by increasing RNA synthesis and viral load (these changes being positively correlated with central nervous system damage), the strength of the immune response and animal mortality. The introduction of only pairs of amino acid substitutions into the genome of a non-mouse adapted DENV-1 strain was sufficient to alter viral fitness substantially. Given current limitations to our understanding of the molecular basis of dengue neuropathogenesis, these results could contribute to the development of attenuated strains for use in vaccinations and provide insights into virus/host interactions and new information about the mechanisms of basic dengue biology."""

The EZIKVis composed of three structural and functional domains (EDI, EDII, and EDIII), which share extensive sequence conservation with the corresponding counterparts expressed by other flaviviruses, particularly the different dengue virus (DENV) subtypes.Methods:In this study, we carried out a systematic comparison of the antigenicity and immunogenicity of recombinant EZIKV, EDI/IIZIKV and EDIIIZIKV produced in E. coli BL21 and Drosophila S2 cells. For the antigenicity analysis we collected 88 serum samples from ZIKV-infected participants and 57 serum samples from DENV-infected. For immunogenicity, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with two doses of EZIKV, EDI/IIZIKV and EDIIIZIKV produced in E. coli BL21 and Drosophila S2 cells to evaluate humoral and cellular immune response. In addition, AG129 mice were immunized with EZIKV and then challenge with ZIKV.Results:Testing of samples collected from ZIKV-infected and DENV-infected participants demonstrated that the EZIKV and EDIIIZIKV produced in BL21 cells presented better sensitivity and specificity compared to proteins produced in S2 cells. In vivo analyses were carried out with C57BL/6 mice and the results indicated that, despite similar immunogenicity, antigens produced in S2 cells, particularly EZIKV and EDIIIZIKV, induced higher ZIKV-neutralizing antibody levels in vaccinated mice. In addition, immunization with EZIKV expressed in S2 cells delayed the onset of symptoms and increased survival rates in immunocompromised mice.

Dengue-endemic countries are often unable to cope with such increases, with health care facilities becoming overwhelmed during each dengue season. Furthermore, although dengue has been predominantly a childhood illness in the past, it currently mostly affects adults in many countries, with higher incidence of severe disease and mortality rates in pregnant women and in those with comorbidities. As there is currently no specific treatment for dengue and no early biomarker to identify those who will progress to develop vascular leakage, all individuals with dengue are closely monitored in case they need fluid management. Furthermore, diagnosing patients with acute dengue is challenging due to the similarity of clinical symptoms during early illness and poor sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care diagnostic tests. Novel vector control methods, such as the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, have shown promising results by reducing vector density and dengue incidence in clinical trial settings. A new dengue vaccine, TAK-003, had an efficacy of 61.2% against virologically confirmed dengue, 84.1% efficacy against hospitalizations and a 70% efficacy against development of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) at 54 months. While vaccines and mosquito control methods are welcome, they alone are unlikely to fully reduce the burden of dengue, and a treatment for dengue is therefore essential. Several novel antiviral drugs are currently being evaluated along with drugs that inhibit host mediators, such as mast cell products. Although viral proteins such as NS1 contribute to the vascular leak observed in severe dengue, the host immune response to the viral infection also plays a significant role in progression to severe disease.

A hallmark of plus-strand RNA viruses is the remodeling of intracellular membranes to establish replication organelles (so-called """"replication factories""""), which provide a protected environment for the replicase complex, consisting of the viral genome and proteins necessary for viral RNA synthesis. In the current study, we investigate pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences in the life cycle of this highly relevant group of viruses. We first measured the kinetics of viral RNA, viral protein, and infectious virus particle production of hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in the immuno-compromised Huh7 cell line and thus without perturbations by an intrinsic immune response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailed mathematical model of the replication of HCV, DENV, and CVB3 and showed that only small virus-specific changes in the model were necessary to describe the in vitro dynamics of the different viruses. Our model correctly predicted virus-specific mechanisms such as host cell translation shut off and different kinetics of replication organelles. Further, our model suggests that the ability to suppress or shut down host cell mRNA translation may be a key factor for in vitro replication efficiency, which may determine acute self-limited or chronic infection. We further analyzed potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatment options in silico and found that targeting viral RNA translation, such as polyprotein cleavage and viral RNA synthesis, may be the most promising drug targets for all plus-strand RNA viruses. Moreover, we found that targeting only the formation of replicase complexes did not stop the in vitro viral replication early in infection, while inhibiting intracellular trafficking processes may even lead to amplified viral growth."""

Although pegylated IFNs have been used to treat hepatitis B and C virus infections for decades, they exert substantial side effects that limit their use. Current efforts are directed toward the use of PRR agonists as an alternative approach to elicit host antiviral responses in a manner similar to that achieved in a natural infection.

We evaluated the antiviral action of Mt-I (catalytically-active sPLA2) and Mt-II (catalytically-inactive variant) isolated from the venom of Bothrops asper, against a diverse group of viruses. Yellow Fever and Dengue (enveloped) viruses were highly susceptible to inactivation by the snake proteins, in contrast to Sabin (non-enveloped; Polio vaccine strain), and Influenza A, Herpes simplex 1 and 2, and Vesicular Stomatitis (enveloped) viruses. Titration of the antiviral effect against Dengue virus revealed Mt-I to be highly potent (IC500.5-2 ng/mL), whereas Mt-II was 1000-fold weaker. This large difference suggested a requirement for PLA2activity, which was confirmed by chemical inactivation of Mt-I. A synthetic peptide representing the membrane-disrupting region of Mt-II, previously shown to have bactericidal effect, lacked antiviral action, suggesting that the weak virucidal effect observed for Mt-II is likely caused by contamination with traces of Mt-I. On the other hand, Mt-I was demonstrated to act by a direct virucidal mechanism prior to infection, and not by an independent effect on host cells, either pretreated, or exposed to Mt-I after virus infection. Interestingly, DENV2 propagated in mosquito cells was much more sensitive to the action of Mt-I, compared to human cell-propagated virus. Therefore, differences in envelope membrane composition may be crucially involved in the observed virucidal action of PLA2enzymes."""

In this study, we used a mouse-passaged DENV2 strain, S221, to investigate the role of CD8(+) T cells in the immune response to primary DENV infection. S221 did not replicate well in wild-type mice, but did induce a CD8(+) T cell response, whereas viral replication and a robust CD8(+) T cell response were observed after infection of IFN-alpha/betaR(-/-) mice. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells from IFN-alpha/betaR(-/-) mice before infection resulted in significantly higher viral loads compared with undepleted mice. Mapping the specificity of the CD8(+) T cell response led to the identification of 12 epitopes derived from 6 of the 10 DENV proteins, with a similar immunodominance hierarchy observed in wild-type and IFN-alpha/betaR(-/-) mice. DENV-specific CD8(+) T cells produced IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, expressed cell surface CD107a, and exhibited cytotoxic activity in vivo. Finally, immunization with four of the immunodominant CD8(+) T cell epitopes enhanced viral clearance. Collectively, our results reveal an important role for CD8(+) T cells in the host defense against DENV and demonstrate that the anti-DENV CD8(+) T cell response can be enhanced by immunization, providing rationale for designing DENV-specific vaccines that induce cell-mediated immunity."""

In this review, we discuss the main advances in the field sinceWolbachia'santiviral effect was discovered 12 years ago, identifying current research gaps and potential future developments. We discuss that the antiviral effect works against a broad range of RNA viruses and depends on theWolbachialineage. We describe what is known about the mechanisms behind viral protection, and that recent studies suggest two possible mechanisms: activation of host immunity or competition with virus for cellular resources. We also discuss how association withWolbachiamay influence the evolution of virus defense on the insect host genome.

The development of successful vaccines is thus one of the major achievements in medical history and may have saved more lives than antibiotics. Whereas the first vaccines were developed in a rather empiric way, new insights into the immunological mechanisms of a successful vaccine response allow modifications of the generally used vaccination protocols and are a prerequisite for the generation of vaccines against new pathogens such as HIV, malaria, dengue virus and others. The aim of effective vaccine development is an avirulent, non-invasive, non-replicating vaccine, which induces long-lived, pathogen-specific immune responses. The addition of adjuvants, modifications of the dose, dose interval and application route can improve antibody-titers and cellular immune responses and thus improve vaccination outcome. On the other hand primary or secondary immunodeficiency leads to an increased susceptibility for infectious diseases and impaired immune responses to vaccinations. These patients should be vaccinated with dead vaccines, whereas live vaccines are generally contraindicated.

Among these mechanisms is the ability to regulate its replication rate, which may contribute to avoiding premature immune activation that limit infection dissemination: DENVs associated with dengue epidemics have shown slower replication rate than pre-epidemic strains. Correspondingly, wild-type DENVs replicate more slowly than their clinically attenuated derivatives. To understand how DENVs 'make haste slowly', we generated and screened for DENV2 mutants with accelerated replication that also induced high type-I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells. We chanced upon a single NS2B-I114T amino acid substitution, in an otherwise highly conserved amino acid residue. Accelerated DENV2 replication damaged host DNA as mutant infection was dependent on host DNA damage repair factors, namely RAD21, EID3 and NEK5. DNA damage induced cGAS/STING signalling and activated early type-I IFN response that inhibited infection dissemination. Unexpectedly, STING activation also supported mutant DENV replication in infected cells through STING-induced autophagy. Our findings thus show that DENV NS2B has multi-faceted role in controlling DENV replication rate and immune evasion and suggest that the dual role of STING in supporting virus replication within infected cells but inhibiting infection dissemination could be particularly advantageous for live attenuated vaccine development."""

Thus far, the goal of developing a safe, live attenuated vaccine effective after a single dose has remained elusive. Here we used a replication-defective (single-cycle) flavivirus platform, RepliVax, to generate a safe, single-dose TBE vaccine. Several RepliVax-TBE candidates attenuated by a deletion in the capsid gene were constructed using different flavivirus backbones containing the envelope genes of TBE virus. RepliVax-TBE based on a West Nile virus backbone (RV-WN/TBE) grew more efficiently in helper cells than candidates based on Langat E5, TBE, and yellow fever 17D backbones, and was found to be highly immunogenic and efficacious in mice. Live chimeric yellow fever 17D/TBE, Dengue 2/TBE, and Langat E5/TBE candidates were also constructed but were found to be underattenuated. RV-WN/TBE was demonstrated to be highly immunogenic in Rhesus macaques after a single dose, inducing a significantly more durable humoral immune response compared with three doses of a licensed, adjuvanted human inactivated vaccine. Its immunogenicity was not significantly affected by preexisting immunity against WN. Immunized monkeys were protected from a stringent surrogate challenge. These results support the identification of a single-cycle TBE vaccine with a superior product profile to existing inactivated vaccines, which could lead to improved vaccine coverage and control of the disease."""

In this study, we demonstrate the significance of in-depth analysis of microbiota composition in the serum samples of dengue-infected patients.Materials and methods:RNA was extracted from the serum samples collected from 24 dengue positive patients. The human mapped reads generated through RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) were removed, while the unmapped (non-human) reads were employed for microbial taxonomic classification using Kraken2 and Bracken2. Further, we assessed the initial blood parameters analyzing the complete blood count (CBC) profile of the patients.Results:Findings revealed differential abundance of commensals and pathogenic microbes in the early febrile period of hospitalized dengue patients, segregated into, High Viral Reads (HVR) and Low Viral Reads (LVR). The Campylobacter genus was abundant in the HVR whereas Lactobacillus dominated the LVR patients. At species level, the microbiota of HVR exhibited higher abundance of unique potential opportunistic microbes, compared to the commensal microbes' enrichment in the LVR patients'. We hypothesize that the DENV might alter the microbiota composition as observed by the increase in preponderance of opportunistic pathogens and an absence of commensals in the HVR. The presence of commensals in the LVR might explain, i) overall lower dengue viral reads compared to the HVR, and ii) shift in lymphocytes (high) and neutrophils (low) counts; resulting in a comparatively milder clinical manifestation in this group. Our findings may help in understanding the co-infection aspect that will be important to develop dengue therapeutics and vaccines.Discussion:This study highlights the potential of the unexplored roles of the TAMs in modulating the dengue disease severity using the metatranscriptomic sequencing.

As with other viral pathogens, dengue virus is dependent on its host to perform the bulk of functions necessary for viral survival and replication. To be successful, dengue must manipulate host cell biological processes towards its own ends, while avoiding elimination by the immune system. Protein-protein interactions between the virus and its host are one avenue through which dengue can connect and exploit these host cellular pathways and processes.Methodology/principal findings:We implemented a computational approach to predict interactions between Dengue virus (DENV) and both of its hosts, Homo sapiens and the insect vector Aedes aegypti. Our approach is based on structural similarity between DENV and host proteins and incorporates knowledge from the literature to further support a subset of the predictions. We predict over 4,000 interactions between DENV and humans, as well as 176 interactions between DENV and A. aegypti. Additional filtering based on shared Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of predictions to approximately 2,000 for humans and 18 for A. aegypti. Of 19 experimentally validated interactions between DENV and humans extracted from the literature, this method was able to predict nearly half (9). Additional predictions suggest specific interactions between virus and host proteins relevant to interferon signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress, and the unfolded protein response.Conclusions/significance:Dengue virus manipulates cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's protein interaction network.

It has been speculated that these complications are mediated by cross-reactive host-immune responses. We have begun to analyze human T cell responses to dengue antigens in vitro to explain the possible role of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of these complications. Dengue antigens induce proliferative responses of PBMC from dengue antibody-positive donors, but do not induce specific proliferative responses of PBMC from dengue antibody-negative donors. IFN gamma is detected in the culture fluids of dengue-immune PBMC stimulated with dengue antigens. The cells that proliferate in the dengue antigen-stimulated bulk cultures have CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD16-, and CD20- phenotypes. Dengue-specific T cell lines were established using limiting dilution techniques. They have CD3+, CD4+, and CD8- phenotypes, and produce IFN gamma in response to dengue antigens. Culture fluids from dengue-immune PBMC stimulated with dengue antigens, which contain IFN gamma, augment dengue virus infection of human monocytes by dengue virus-antibody complexes. These results indicate that PBMC from dengue-immune donors contain CD4+ T cells that proliferate and produce IFN gamma after stimulation with dengue antigens, and suggest that the IFN gamma that is produced by these stimulated dengue-specific T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome by increasing the number of dengue virus-infected monocytes in the presence of cross-reactive anti-dengue antibodies."""

Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies prepared to BinJV viral proteins, we confirmed a close relationship between HVV and BinJV and revealed that they were antigenically quite divergent from other lineage II ISFs. We also constructed chimeric viruses between BinJV and the vertebrate-infecting West Nile virus (WNV) by swapping the structural genes (prM and E) to produce BinJ/WNVKUN-prME and WNVKUN/BinJV-prME. This allowed us to assess the role of different regions of the BinJV genome in vertebrate host restriction and revealed that while BinJV structural proteins facilitated entry to vertebrate cells, the process was inefficient. In contrast, the BinJV replicative components in wild-type BinJV and BinJ/WNVKUN-prME failed to initiate replication in a wide range of vertebrate cell lines at 37°C, including cells lacking components of the innate immune response. However, trace levels of replication of BinJ/WNVKUN-prME could be detected in some cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in antiviral responses (IFNAR-/-MEFs or RNase L-/-MEFs) incubated at 34°C after inoculation.

Analysis of targeting efficiencies for 95 HLA class I alleles over thousands of human proteins and 52 human viruses indicates that HLA molecules preferentially target conserved regions in these proteomes, although the arboviral Flaviviridae are a notable exception where nonconserved regions are preferentially targeted by most alleles. HLA-A alleles and several HLA-B alleles that have maintained close sequence identity with chimpanzee homologues target conserved human proteins and DNA viruses such as Herpesviridae and Adenoviridae most efficiently, while all HLA-B alleles studied efficiently target RNA viruses.

Major advances in characterizing viral replication have led to the development of direct-acting anti-viral therapies that have considerably improved patient treatment outcome and can even cure chronic infection. However, the high cost of these treatments, their low barrier to viral resistance, and their inability to prevent HCV-induced liver cancer, along with the absence of an effective HCV vaccine, all underscore the need for continued efforts to understand the biology of this virus. Moreover, beyond informing therapies, enhanced knowledge of HCV biology is itself extremely valuable for understanding the biology of related viruses, such as dengue virus, which is becoming a growing global health concern. Major advances have been realized over the last few years in HCV biology and pathogenesis, such as the discovery of the envelope glycoprotein E2 core structure, the generation of the first mouse model with inheritable susceptibility to HCV, and the characterization of virus-host interactions that regulate viral replication or innate immunity. Here, we review the recent findings that have significantly advanced our understanding of HCV and highlight the major challenges that remain."""

The study of human mAbs isolated from subjects with prior immunity has become a mainstay for rational structure-based, next-generation vaccine development. The plethora of detailed molecular and genetic studies coupling the structure of antigen-antibody complexes with their antiviral function has begun to reveal common principles of critical interactions on which we can build better vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. This review outlines the approaches to isolating and studying human antiviral mAbs and discusses the common principles underlying the basis for their activity.

The expression of the recombinant 79E protein in HEK 293 cells was confirmed by Western blot. Vectors packaged with novel AAV capsids (AAV2/8 or AAV2/rh32.33) were injected into C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly. Dengue virus antigen was produced in the mice and induced long-lasting antibody responses against the dengue virus still detectable 20 weeks after immunization. AAV2/8 vaccine induced higher anti-dengue virus antibody levels than AAV2/rh32.33 vaccine or AAV plasmid. Furthermore, the anti-dengue antibodies could neutralize homogeneous dengue virus. These results demonstrated that the AAV vaccines possessed appropriate immunogenicity and could be used for the development of an effective dengue vaccine."""

The present study investigated functional changes using an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system in four (brain, dermal, pulmonary and retinal) human microvascular endothelial cell (MEC) lines infected with purified dengue virus, followed by assessment of cytokine profiles and the expression of inter-endothelial junctional proteins. Modelling of changes in electrical impedance suggests that vascular leakage in dengue-infected MECs is mostly due to the modulation of cell-to-cell interactions, while this loss of vascular barrier function observed in the infected MECs varied between cell lines and DENV serotypes. High levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CCL2 and CCL20) and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) were differentially produced in the four infected MECs. Further, the tight junctional protein, ZO-1, was down-regulated in both the DENV-1-infected brain and pulmonary MECs, while claudin-1, PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin were differentially expressed in these two MECs after infection. Non-purified virus stock was also studied to investigate the impact of virus stock purity on dengue-specific immune responses, and the results suggest that virus stock propagated through cell culture may include factors that mask or alter the DENV-specific immune responses of the MECs. The findings of the present study show that high DENV load differentially modulates human microvascular endothelial barrier function and disrupts the function of inter-endothelial junctional proteins during early infection with organ-specific cytokine production."""

However, some viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), usurp autophagy to enhance their replication. The mechanism for a positive role of autophagy in DENV infection is unclear. We present data that DENV induction of autophagy regulates cellular lipid metabolism. DENV infection leads to an autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to release free fatty acids. This results in an increase in cellular β-oxidation, which generates ATP. These processes are required for efficient DENV replication. Importantly, exogenous fatty acids can supplant the requirement of autophagy in DENV replication. These results define a role for autophagy in DENV infection and provide a mechanism by which viruses can alter cellular lipid metabolism to promote their replication."""

Yet many of the pathophysiological mechanisms of host responses during DENV infection remain largely unknown and incompletely understood.Methods:Using a mouse model, the miRNA expressions in liver during DENV-1 infection was investigated using high throughput miRNA sequencing. The differential expressions of miRNAs were then validated by qPCR, followed by target genes prediction. The identified miRNA targets were subjected to gene ontology (GO) annotation and pathway enrichment analysis to elucidate the potential biological pathways and molecular mechanisms associated with DENV-1 infection.Results:A total of 224 and 372 miRNAs out of 433 known mouse miRNAs were detected in the livers of DENV-1-infected and uninfected mice, respectively; of these, 207 miRNAs were present in both libraries. The miR-148a-3p and miR-122-5p were the two most abundant miRNAs in both groups. Thirty-one miRNAs were found to have at least 2-fold change in upregulation or downregulation, in which seven miRNAs were upregulated and 24 miRNAs were downregulated in the DENV-1-infected mouse livers. The miR-1a-3p was found to be the most downregulated miRNA in the DENV-1-infected mouse livers, with a significant fold change of 0.10.

However, Mϕ are heterogeneous and their phenotypic and functional diversities are influenced by cytokines that regulate their differentiation, tissue distribution, and defense against invading pathogens. In vitro, human primary macrophages are derived from peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These are essential for developing tissue/resting macrophages (M-Mϕ) and inflammatory macrophages (GM-Mϕ), respectively. While IFN production is similar between M-Mϕ and GM-Mϕ, M-Mϕ cannot produce IL-1β after DV infection. In contrast, GM-Mϕ is more susceptible to DV infection and DV triggers CLEC5A in GM-Mϕ to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, which in turn release IL-18 and IL-1β that are critical for Th17 activation and contribute to disease severity. Thus, GM-Mϕ is more representative than M-Mϕ for investigating inflammasome activation in dengue infection, and is invaluable for revealing the molecular mechanism of pathogen-induced inflammatory reaction. Distinct phenotypes of macrophage subsets under the influence of M-CSF and GM-CSF raise the question of optimal conditions for culturing primary macrophages to study host-pathogen interaction."""

During infections mosquitoes can activate the immune pathways Toll, IMD and JAK/STAT to limit pathogen replication.Results:Here, we evaluate the immune response profile of Ae. aegypti against Sindbis virus (SINV). We analyzed gene expression of components of Toll, IMD and JAK/STAT pathways and showed that a blood meal and virus infection upregulated aaREL2 in a microbiota-dependent fashion, since this induction was prevented by antibiotic. The presence of the microbiota activates IMD and impaired the replication of SINV in the midgut. Constitutive activation of the IMD pathway, by Caspar depletion, leads to a decrease in microbiota levels and an increase in SINV loads.Conclusion:Together, these results suggest that a blood meal is able to activate innate immune pathways, through a nutrient induced growth of microbiota, leading to upregulation of aaREL2 and IMD activation. Microbiota levels seemed to have a reciprocal interaction, where the proliferation of the microbiota activates IMD pathway that in turn controls bacterial levels, allowing SINV replication in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. The activation of the IMD pathway seems to have an indirect effect in SINV levels that is induced by the microbiota."""

We evaluated nongenetic host factors, including socioeconomic, environmental, cultural, demographic, and acquired immunity status that could have influenced these differences. While differences in incidence rates were not significant between Caucasians and non-Caucasians, differences in mortality and case fatality rates were statistically significant for all epidemics tested (P < 0.01). Caucasians diagnosed with YF were 6.8 times more likely to succumb than non-Caucasians with the disease. No other major causes of death during the 19th century demonstrated a similar mortality skew toward Caucasians. Nongenetic host factors were examined and could not explain these large differences. We propose that the remarkably lower case mortality rates for individuals of non-Caucasian ancestry is the result of human genetic variation in loci encoding innate immune mediators.Importance:Different degrees of severity of yellow fever have been observed across diverse populations, but this study is the first to demonstrate a statistically significant association between ancestry and the outcome of yellow fever (YF). With the global burden of mosquito-borne flaviviral infections, such as YF and dengue, on the rise, identifying and characterizing host factors could prove pivotal in the prevention of epidemics and the development of effective treatments."""

Viral siRNAs are at the core of the antiviral RNA interference machinery, one of the key pathways that limit virus replication in invertebrates. Besides siRNAs, Aedes mosquitoes and cells derived from these insects produce arbovirus-derived piRNAs, the best studied examples being viruses from the Togaviridae or Bunyaviridae families. Host miRNAs modulate the expression of a large number of genes and their levels may change in response to viral infections. In addition, some viruses, mostly with a DNA genome, express their own miRNAs to regulate host and viral gene expression. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of both viral and host-derived small RNAs in Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells infected with dengue virus 2 (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family. Aag2 cells are competent in producing all three types of small RNAs and provide a powerful tool to explore the crosstalk between arboviral infection and the distinct RNA silencing pathways. Interestingly, besides the well-characterized DENV-derived siRNAs, a specific population of viral piRNAs was identified in infected Aag2 cells. Knockdown of Piwi5, Ago3 and, to a lesser extent, Piwi6 results in reduction of vpiRNA levels, providing the first genetic evidence that Aedes PIWI proteins produce DENV-derived small RNAs. In contrast, we do not find convincing evidence for the production of virus-derived miRNAs. Neither do we find that host miRNA expression is strongly changed upon DENV2 infection. Finally, our deep-sequencing analyses detect 30 novel Aedes miRNAs, complementing the repertoire of regulatory small RNAs in this important vector species."""

Since activation of RNase L during infection typically limits virus production dramatically, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to knockout (KO) targeted host genes involved in the RNase L pathway to evaluate the effects of RNase L on ZIKV infection in human A549 cells. RNase L was activated in response to ZIKV infection, which degraded ZIKV genomic RNA. Surprisingly, despite viral genome reduction, RNase L activity did not reduce ZIKV infectious titers. In contrast, both the flavivirus dengue virus and the alphavirus Sindbis virus replicated to significantly higher titers in RNase L KO cells compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Using MAVS/RNase L double KO cells, we demonstrated that the absence of increased ZIKV production in RNase L KO cells was not due to compensation by enhanced type I interferon transcripts to thus inhibit virus production. Finally, when synthetic double-stranded RNA was detected by OAS3 to induce RNase L antiviral activity prior to ZIKV infection, we observed reduced ZIKV replication factory formation, as well as a 42-fold reduction in virus yield in WT but not RNase L KO cells. This study proposes that ZIKV evades RNase L antiviral activity by generating a viral genome reservoir protected from RNase L cleavage during early infection, allowing for sufficient virus production before RNase L activation is detectable.IMPORTANCEWith the onset of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak, ZIKV pathogenesis has been of extreme global public health interest, and a better understanding of interactions with the host would provide insight into molecular mechanisms driving the severe neurological outcomes of ZIKV disease. Here is the initial report on the relationship between ZIKV and the host oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L (OAS-RNase L) system, a potent antiviral pathway effective at restricting replication of diverse viruses. Our study elucidated a unique mechanism whereby ZIKV production is impervious to antiviral RNase L activity, through a mechanism of viral RNA protection that is not mimicked during infection with numerous other RNase L-activating viruses, thus identifying a distinct replication strategy potentially important for ZIKV pathogenesis."""

However, Gal-9 can be pro-inflammatory in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. Using microarray analysis, we observed that Gal-9 was up-regulated in human dendritic cells (DCs) after dengue virus (DV) infection. The investigation into the immunomodulatory effects and mechanisms of Gal-9 in DCs exposed to DV revealed that DV infection specifically increased mRNA and protein levels of Gal-9 but not those of Gal-1 or Gal-3. Blocking p38, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), inhibited DV-induced expression of Gal-9. Reduction in Gal-9 by small interference RNA treatment suppressed DV-stimulated migration of DCs towards the chemoattractants CCL19 and CCL21. In addition, DV-induced IL-12p40 production was reduced after knockdown of Gal-9 in DCs. Furthermore, Gal-9 deficiency suppressed DV-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB. Inhibition of DV-induced DC migration under conditions of Gal-9 deficiency was mediated through suppressing ERK activation but not by regulating the expression of CCR7, the receptor for CCL19 and CCL21. Both the reduction in IL-12 production and the suppression of ERK activity might account for the inhibition of DV-induced DC migration after knockdown of Gal-9. In summary, this study reveals the roles of Gal-9 in DV-induced migration of DCs. The findings indicate that Gal-9 might be a therapeutic target for preventing immunopathogenesis induced by DV infection."""

Several dengue vaccines are at developing stage, none are yet available for humans. There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy available for dengue fever till date. Domain III of envelope protein is involved in binding to host receptors and it contains type and subtype-specific epitopes that elicit virus neutralizing antibodies. Hence domain III is an attractive vaccine candidate. In the present study we report the immunomodulatory potential of refolded D4EIII protein in combination with various adjuvants (Freunds Complete adjuvant, Montanide ISA720, Alum). Mice were tested for humoral immune responses by ELISA, immunofluorescence assay and plaque reduction neutralization test. Cell mediated immune response was tested by lymphocyte proliferation assay and cytokine profiling. All the formulations resulted in high antibody titers that neutralized the virus entry in vitro. D4EIII in combination with montanide ISA720 and Feuds complete adjuvant gave highest antibody endpoint titers followed by alum. The level of antigen-stimulated splenocyte proliferation and cytokine production was comparable to that obtained from Con A stimulation and cytokine profiling of stimulated splenocyte culture supernatants indicated that all the adjuvant formulations have induced cell mediated immune response as well. These findings suggest that D4EIII in combination with compatible adjuvants is highly immunogenic and can elicit high titer neutralizing antibodies and cell mediated immune response which plays an important role in intracellular infections, which proves that refolded D4EIII can be a potential vaccine candidate."""

Furthermore, ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with fetal microcephaly and neurological disorders. The identification of host molecular mechanisms responsible for the modulation of different signaling pathways in response to ZIKV is the first step to finding potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets and understanding disease outcomes. In the last decade, it has been shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators involved in virtually all cellular processes. miRNAs present in body fluids can not only serve as key biomarkers for diagnostics and prognosis of human disorders but also contribute to cellular signaling offering new insights into pathological mechanisms. Here, we describe for the first time ZIKV-induced changes in miRNA plasma levels in patients during the acute and recovery phases of infection. We observed that during ZIKV acute infection, among the dysregulated miRNAs (DMs), the majority is with decreased levels when compared to convalescent and control patients.

Antibodies to any one DENV serotype which can protect against homotypic re-infection, do not offer heterotypic cross-protection. In fact, cross-reactive antibodies may augment heterotypic DENV infection through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). A recently launched live attenuated vaccine (LAV) for dengue, which consists of a mixture of four chimeric yellow-fever/dengue vaccine viruses, may be linked to the induction of disease-enhancing antibodies. This is likely related to viral interference among the replicating viral strains, resulting in an unbalanced immune response, as well as to the fact that the LAV encodes prM, a DENV protein documented to elicit ADE-mediating antibodies. This makes it imperative to explore the feasibility of alternate ADE risk-free vaccine candidates. Our quest for a non-replicating vaccine centered on the DENV envelope (E) protein which mediates virus entry into the host cell and serves as an important target of the immune response. Serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes and the host receptor recognition function map to E domain III (EDIII). Recently, we found thatPichia pastoris-expressed DENV E protein, of all four serotypes, self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of prM. Significantly, these VLPs displayed EDIII and elicited EDIII-focused DENV-neutralizing antibodies in mice. We now report the creation and characterization of a novel non-replicating recombinant particulate vaccine candidate, produced by co-expressing the E proteins of DENV-1 and DENV-2 inP. pastoris. The two E proteins co-assembled into bivalent mosaic VLPs (mVLPs) designated as mE1E2bvVLPs. The mVLP, which preserved the serotype-specific antigenic integrity of its two component proteins, elicited predominantly EDIII-focused homotypic virus-neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice, demonstrating its efficacy. In anin vivoADE model, mE1E2bvVLP-induced antibodies lacked discernible ADE potential, compared to the cross-reactive monoclonal antibody 4G2, as evidenced by significant reduction in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, suggesting inherent safety. The results obtained with these bivalent mVLPs suggest the feasibility of incorporating the E proteins of DENV-3 and DENV-4 to create a tetravalent mVLP vaccine."""

Because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus-infected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever.Methodology/principal findings:Using microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR method to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples, we identified differentially expressed genes along three major pathways; NF-kappaB initiated immune responses, type I interferon (IFN) and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor. Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA. A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication. The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which reduced viral replication.Conclusion/significance:Unbiased gene expression analysis has identified new host genes associated with dengue infection, which we have validated in functional studies. We showed that some parts of the host response can be used as potential biomarkers for the disease while others can be used to control dengue viral replication, thus representing viable targets for drug therapy."""

Immunity induced by exposure to one serotype does not confer long-term protection against secondary infection with other serotypes and is potentially capable of enhancing this infection. Although vaccination is believed to induce durable and protective responses against all the dengue virus (DENV) serotypes in order to reduce the burden posed by this virus, the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine remains a challenge. Immunoinformatics and computational vaccinology have been utilized in studies of infectious diseases to provide insight into the host-pathogen interactions thus justifying their use in vaccine development. Since vaccination is the best bet to reduce the burden posed by DENV, this study is aimed at developing a multi-epitope based vaccines for dengue control. Combined approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics were utilized to design multi-epitope based vaccine from the sequence of DENV. Specifically, BCPreds and IEDB servers were used to predict the B-cell and T-cell epitopes, respectively. Molecular docking was carried out using Schrödinger, PATCHDOCK and FIREDOCK. Codon optimization and in silico cloning were done using JCAT and SnapGene respectively. Finally, the efficiency and stability of the designed vaccines were assessed by an in silico immune simulation and molecular dynamic simulation, respectively. The predicted epitopes were prioritized using in-house criteria. Four candidate vaccines (DV-1-4) were designed using suitable adjuvant and linkers in addition to the shortlisted epitopes. The binding interactions of these vaccines against the receptors TLR-2, TLR-4, MHC-1 and MHC-2 show that these candidate vaccines perfectly fit into the binding domains of the receptors. In addition, DV-1 has a better binding energies of - 60.07, - 63.40, - 69.89 kcal/mol against MHC-1, TLR-2, and TLR-4, with respect to the other vaccines. All the designed vaccines were highly antigenic, soluble, non-allergenic, non-toxic, flexible, and topologically assessable. The immune simulation analysis showed that DV-1 may elicit specific immune response against dengue virus. Moreover, codon optimization and in silico cloning validated the expressions of all the designed vaccines in E. coli.

However, information on viral replication dynamics obtained from traditional bulk assays with host cell populations is inherently limited as the data represent averages over a multitude of unsynchronized replication cycles. Here, we use time-lapse imaging of virus replication in thousands of single cells, combined with computational inference, to identify rate-limiting steps for dengue virus (DENV), a widespread human pathogen. Comparing wild-type DENV with a vaccine candidate mutant, we show that the viral spread in the mutant is greatly attenuated by delayed onset of productive replication, whereas wild-type and mutant virus have identical replication rates. Single-cell analysis done after applying the broad-spectrum antiviral drug, ribavirin, at clinically relevant concentrations revealed the same mechanism of attenuating viral spread. We conclude that the initial steps of infection, rather than the rate of established replication, are quantitatively limiting DENV spread."""

We show that the NS3 protein of Zika virus (ZIKV) antagonizes antiviral gene induction by RIG-I and MDA5 by binding to and sequestering the scaffold proteins 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3η. 14-3-3-binding is mediated by a negatively charged RLDP motif in NS3 that is conserved in ZIKV strains of African and Asian lineages and is similar to the one found in dengue and West Nile viruses. ZIKV NS3 is sufficient to inhibit the RLR-14-3-3ϵ/η interaction and to suppress antiviral signaling. Mutational perturbation of 14-3-3ϵ/η binding in a recombinant ZIKV leads to enhanced innate immune responses and impaired growth kinetics.

It is a life-threatening mosquito-borne viral infection widely spread in tropical areas. Dengue virus transmission occurs from an infectedAedesmosquito to humans. Various factors are responsible for the occurrence of the disease, such as viral load, age of the host, immune status of the host, and genetic variability. Dengue infection occurs in three phases: febrile, critical, and recovery. The febrile phase lasts for seven days and manifests symptoms such as high-grade fever, headache, arthralgia, and backache, and in some cases, the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract are also involved. Severe dengue is characterized by endothelial dysfunction that causes vascular permeability and plasma leakage. The fundamental mechanisms of these immune pathologies are not yet known. Dengue manifests various complications such as dengue encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, ocular involvement, acute transverse myelitis, myalgia, and cerebellar syndrome, but the most commonly seen is liver involvement. Dengue is managed supportively because there are no proven curative treatments. The cornerstone of care during the critical period of dengue is prudent fluid resuscitation. The first fluid of preference is a crystalloid. Prophylactic transfusion of platelets is not advised. The occurrence of four antigenically different dengue virus serotypes, each able to elicit a cross-reactive and disease-enhancing antibody response against the other three serotypes, has made the creation of the dengue vaccine a difficult undertaking. The development of a dengue vaccine has faced significant challenges due to a lack of the best animal models and a variety of immunological conditions in people, particularly in endemic locations. Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine, which was developed by Sanofi. It is made up of four chimeric vaccine viruses produced by Vero cells."""

There are numerous questions regarding how DENV seizes cellular machinery and cholesterol to improve viral production and the effect of cholesterol sequestering agents on the cellular antiviral response. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of DENV replication induced by agents that diminish intracellular cholesterol levels. Cholesterol synthesis was pharmacologically (fluvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin treatment) and genetically (HMGCR‑RNAi) inhibited, in uninfected and DENV2‑infected hepatoma Huh‑7 cells. The cholesterol levels, DENV titer and cellular antiviral expression profile were evaluated. A reduction in the DENV titer, measured as plaque forming units, was observed in DENV‑infected cells following 48 h treatment with 10 µM fluvastatin, 10 µM atorvastatin, 20 µM lovastatin and 20 µM simvastatin, which achieved 70, 70, 65 and 55% DENV2 inhibition, respectively, compared with the untreated cells. In addition, the cytopathic effect was reduced in the statin‑treated DENV‑infected cells. Statins simultaneously reduced cholesterol levels at 48 h, with the exception of DENV2 infected cells. Genetic inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was performed using RNA interference for 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑CoA reductase (HMGCR‑siRNA), which indicated a slight reduction in DENV2 titer at 48 h post‑infection, however, with no significant reduction in cholesterol levels. In addition, DENV2 infection was observed to augment the intracellular cholesterol levels in all experimental conditions. Comparison between the cellular antiviral response triggered by DENV2 infection, statin treatment and HMGCR‑siRNA in infected, uninfected, treated and untreated Huh7 cells, showed different expression profiles for the antiviral genes evaluated. All downregulating cholesterol agents evaluated reduced the expression of genes associated with cellular immune and pro‑inflammatory responses. These results indicate that statin-mediated downregulation of DENV2 infectious particles number is independent of cholesterol levels and it is partially mediated by the modulation of the cellular antiviral profile."""

Although ZIKV usually causes mild symptoms, growing evidence is linking it to congenital birth defects and to increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. ZIKV encodes a polyprotein that is processed to produce three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. We investigated the evolution of the viral polyprotein in ZIKV and in related flaviviruses (DENV, Spondweni virus, and Kedougou virus). After accounting for saturation issues, alignment uncertainties, and recombination, we found evidence of episodic positive selection on the branch that separates DENV from the other flaviviruses. NS1 emerged as the major selection target, and selected sites were located in immune epitopes or in functionally important protein regions. Three of these sites are located in an NS1 region that interacts with structural proteins and is essential for virion biogenesis. Analysis of the more recent evolutionary history of ZIKV lineages indicated that positive selection acted on NS5 and NS4B, this latter representing the preferential target. All selected sites were located in the N-terminal portion of NS4B, which inhibits interferon response. One of the positively selected sites (26M/I/T/V) in ZIKV also represents a selection target in sylvatic DENV2 isolates, and a nearby residue evolves adaptively in JEV. Two additional positively selected sites are within a protein region that interacts with host (e.g. STING) and viral (i.e. NS1, NS4A) proteins. Notably, mutations in the NS4B region of other flaviviruses modulate neurovirulence and/or neuroinvasiveness. These results suggest that the positively selected sites we identified modulate viral replication and contribute to immune evasion. These sites should be prioritized in future experimental studies. However, analyses herein detected no selective events associated to the spread of the Asian/American ZIKV lineage."""

Other hypotheses posit a role for competition between Wolbachia and viruses for host cellular resources. Using an A. aegypti cell line infected with Wolbachia, we tested the effects of targeting siRNAs against the major innate immune pathways on dengue virus loads. We show that while Wolbachia infection induces genes in the Toll, JAK/STAT and RNAi pathways, only reduced expression of RNAi leads to a rebound of dengue virus loads in Wolbachia-infected cells. The magnitude of the effect explained less than 10% of the total DENV load, demonstrating that blocking must be dependent on other factors in addition to the expression of RNAi. The findings bode well for the long-term stability of blocking given that immunity gene expression would likely be highly plastic and susceptible to rapid evolution."""

However, the underlying mechanisms of flavivirus structural proteins to evade host immune response remain elusive.Results:We showed that TBEV structural protein, pre-membrane (prM) protein, could inhibit type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Mechanically, TBEV prM interacted with both MDA5 and MAVS and interfered with the formation of MDA5-MAVS complex, thereby impeding the nuclear translocation and dimerization of IRF3 to inhibit RLR antiviral signaling. ZIKV and WNV prM was also demonstrated to interact with both MDA5 and MAVS, while dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and YFV prM associated only with MDA5 or MAVS to suppress IFN-I production. In contrast, JEV prM could not suppress IFN-I production. Overexpression of TBEV and ZIKV prM significantly promoted the replication of TBEV and Sendai virus.Conclusion:Our findings reveal the immune evasion mechanisms of flavivirus prM, which may contribute to understanding flavivirus pathogenicity, therapeutic intervention and vaccine development."""

In this review, we summarize the evidence demonstrating the expression, roles and effects of the best described pro-resolving molecules in the context of bacterial and viral infections. Pro-resolving molecules play a pivotal role in modulating a spectrum of pathways associated with tissue inflammation and damage during both viral and bacterial infections. These molecules offer a blend of anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving and sometimes anti-infective benefits, all the while circumventing the undesired and immune-suppressive unwanted effects associated with glucocorticoids.

Using DENV-infected primary monocytes, we examined caspase-1 at various levels of gene expression and probed for potential immune consequences mediated by caspase-1 such as secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and pyroptotic cell death. We report that DENV-infected monocytes upregulated functional caspase-1 mRNA and pro-caspase-1 activation as a late response to infection.

Many viruses have evolved various mechanisms to develop their own capping enzymes (e.g. flavivirus and coronavirus) or to 'steal' caps from host mRNAs (e.g. influenza virus). Other viruses have developed 'cap-mimicking' mechanisms by attaching a peptide to the 5' end of viral RNA (e.g. picornavirus and calicivirus) or by having a complex 5' RNA structure (internal ribosome entry site) for translation initiation (e.g. picornavirus, pestivirus and hepacivirus). Here we review the diverse viral RNA capping mechanisms. Using flavivirus as a model, we summarize how a single methyltransferase catalyses two distinct N-7 and 2'-O methylations of viral RNA cap in a sequential manner. For antiviral development, a structural feature unique to the flavivirus methyltransferase was successfully used to design selective inhibitors that block viral methyltransferase without affecting host methyltransferases. Functionally, capping is essential for prevention of triphosphate-triggered innate immune activation; N-7 methylation is critical for enhancement of viral translation; and 2'-O methylation is important for subversion of innate immune response during viral infection. Flaviviruses defective in 2'-O methyltransferase are replicative, but their viral RNAs lack 2'-O methylation and are recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such mutant viruses could be rationally designed as live attenuated vaccines. This concept has recently been proved with Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus. The findings obtained with flavivirus should be applicable to other RNA viruses."""

Evidence that climate variability drives these interannual cycles has been highly controversial, chiefly because it is difficult to isolate the contribution of environmental forcing while taking into account nonlinear epidemiological dynamics generated by mechanisms such as host immunity. Here we show that a critical interplay of environmental forcing, specifically climate variability, and temporary immunity explains the interannual disease cycles present in a four-decade cholera time series from Matlab, Bangladesh. We reconstruct the transmission rate, the key epidemiological parameter affected by extrinsic forcing, over time for the predominant strain (El Tor) with a nonlinear population model that permits a contributing effect of intrinsic immunity. Transmission shows clear interannual variability with a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods (over 7 years, for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods (under 7 years, for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation). The importance of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in determining disease dynamics is illustrated during refractory periods, when population susceptibility levels are low as the result of immunity and the size of cholera outbreaks only weakly reflects climate forcing."""

We show that human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells are permissive to the most recent ZIKV isolate, responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia. Several entry and/or adhesion factors, including DC-SIGN, AXL, Tyro3, and, to a lesser extent, TIM-1, permitted ZIKV entry, with a major role for the TAM receptor AXL. The ZIKV permissiveness of human skin fibroblasts was confirmed by the use of a neutralizing antibody and specific RNA silencing.

ZIKV was found to be sensitive to the antiviral effects of both type I and type II interferons. Finally, infection of skin fibroblasts resulted in the formation of autophagosomes, whose presence was associated with enhanced viral replication, as shown by the use of Torin 1, a chemical inducer of autophagy, and the specific autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine.

Vector-mediated transmission of ZIKV is initiated when a blood-feeding female Aedes mosquito injects the virus into the skin of its mammalian host, followed by infection of permissive cells via specific receptors. Indeed, skin immune cells, including dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, were all found to be permissive to ZIKV infection. The results also show a major role for the phosphatidylserine receptor AXL as a ZIKV entry receptor and for cellular autophagy in enhancing ZIKV replication in permissive cells. ZIKV replication leads to activation of an antiviral innate immune response and the production of type I interferons in infected cells.

With its compact surface, ZIKV is more thermally stable than the dengue virus (DENV). ZIKV E proteins have a characteristic """"herringbone"""" structure with a single glycosylation site. The ZIKV E protein, the major protein involved in receptor binding and fusion, is formed as a head-to-tail dimer on the surfaces of viral particles. The E monomer consists of three distinct domains: DI, DII, and DIII. The finger-like DII contains a fusion loop (FL) that is inserted into the host cell endosomal membrane during pH-dependent conformational changes that drive fusion. Quaternary E:E dimer epitopes located at the interaction site of prM and E dimers can be further divided into two dimer epitopes. To date, more than 50 ZIKV vaccine candidates are now in various stages of research and development. Candidate ZIKV vaccines that are currently in phase I/II clinical trials include inactivated whole viruses, recombinant measles viral vector-based vaccines, DNA and mRNA vaccines, and a mosquito salivary peptide vaccine. Stabilized forms of ZIKV E:E dimer proteins have been successfully obtained either by introducing additional inter-subunit disulfide bond(s) in DII or via the direct assembly of E:E dimer proteins by immobilization with monomeric E proteins.

Renal involvement in dengue can be potentially related to an increased mortality. Aiming to better understand the role of DENV in renal injury observed in human fatal cases, post-mortem investigations were performed in four DENV-4 renal autopsies during dengue epidemics in Brazil. Tissues were submitted to histopathology, immunohistochemistry, viral quantification, and characterization of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Probably due the high viral load, several lesions were observed in the renal tissue, such as diffuse mononuclear infiltration around the glomerulus in the cortical region and in the medullary vessels, hyalinosis arteriolar, lymphocytic infiltrate, increased capsular fibrosis, proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) damage, edema, PCT debris formation, and thickening of the basal vessel membrane. These changes were associated with DENV-4 infection, as confirmed by the presence of DENV-specific NS3 protein, indicative of viral replication. The exacerbated presence of mononuclear cells at several renal tissue sites culminated in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, it can be suggested that the renal tissue injury observed here may have been due to the combination of both high viral load and exacerbated host immune response."""

We studied patients enrolled through the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC), which focuses on immune responses to various infections. Blood samples were collected and analyzed from patients during infection and follow-up time points at the convalescent stage. The study included samples from patients with Lyme disease (LD), tuberculosis (TB), malaria (MLA), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV), as well as kidney transplant patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and polyomavirus (BKV) infections. Using an antibody-based assay, we quantified ~ 350 cell surface markers, cytokines, and chemokines involved in inflammation and immunity. Unique protein signatures were identified specific to the acute phase of infection irrespective of the pathogen type, with significant changes during convalescence. In addition, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (TNR6), C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 7 (CCR7), and C-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CCL1) were increased in the acute and convalescent phases across all viral, bacterial, and protozoan compared to blood from healthy donors. Furthermore, despite the differences between pathogens, proteins were enriched in common biological pathways such as cell surface receptor signaling pathway and response to external stimulus. In conclusion, we demonstrated that irrespective of the pathogen type, there are common immunoregulatory and proinflammatory signals."""

Since Sec61 has been shown to be an essential host factor for viral proteostasis, we tested Apra S4 in cellular models of viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and flaviviruses (Zika, West Nile, and Dengue virus). Apra S4 inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner and had high potency particularly against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, with subnanomolar activity in human cells. Characterization studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that Apra S4 impacted a post-entry stage of the viral life-cycle. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Apra S4 blocked formation of stacked double-membrane vesicles, the sites of viral replication. Apra S4 reduced dsRNA formation and prevented viral protein production and trafficking of secretory proteins, especially the spike protein.

To investigate its high adaptability, the DENV induction of host type-I interferon (IFN) was assessed in vitro in human-derived HeLa cells and compared with that induced by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a closely related arbovirus that generally exhibits low viraemia in humans. A sustained viral spread with a poor IFN induction was observed in the DENV-infected cells, whereas the JEV infection resulted in a self-limiting and abortive infection with a high IFN induction. There was no difference between DENV and JEV double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as IFN inducers. Instead, the dsRNA was poorly exposed in the cytosol as late as 48 h post-infection (p.i.), despite the high level of DENV replication in the infected cells. In contrast, the JEV-derived dsRNA appeared in the cytosol as early as 24 h p.i.

In the present study, we reported thatTAP1, as a product of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), had broadly antiviral activity against various viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), adenoviruses (AdV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and influenza virus (PR8) etc. This antiviral activity by TAP1 was further confirmed by series of loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. Our further investigation revealed that TAP1 significantly promoted the interferon (IFN)-β production through activating the TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling transduction.

As such, viral pathogens have devised multiple mechanisms to antagonize this pathway and thus facilitate infection. Dengue virus (DENV) encodes several proteins (NS2a, NS4a, and NS4b) that have been shown individually to inhibit the IFN response. In addition, DENV infection results in reduced levels of expression of STAT2, which is required for IFN signaling (M. Jones, A. Davidson, L. Hibbert, P. Gruenwald, J. Schlaak, S. Ball, G. R. Foster, and M. Jacobs, J. Virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). Translation of the DENV genome results in a single polypeptide, which is processed by viral and host proteases into at least 10 separate proteins. To date, no single DENV protein has been implicated in the targeting of STAT2 for decreased levels of expression. We demonstrate here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression. The decrease in protein level observed requires ubiquitination and proteasome activity, strongly suggesting an active degradation process. Furthermore, we show that the degradation of but not binding to STAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymerase in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation. Thus, the mature form of NS5, when not expressed as a precursor, was able to bind to STAT2 but was unable to target it for degradation, establishing a unique role for viral polyprotein processing in providing an additional function to a viral polypeptide. Therefore, we have identified both a novel mechanism by which DENV evades the innate immune response and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics."""

In combination with carrier proteins, these glycan structures can be highly immunogenic. During natural infection, glycan-binding antibodies are often elicited that correlate with long-lasting protection.

The discovery that dengue virus NS5 protein (DENV-NS5) can also localize to the nucleus has resulted in renewed interest in its potential roles at the host-virus interface. In this study, we have used two complementary computational approaches in parallel - one based on linear motifs (ELM) and another based on tertiary structure of the protein (DALI) - to predict the host proteins that DENV-NS5 might interact with. Of the 42 human proteins predicted by both these methods, 34 are novel. Pathway analysis of these 42 human proteins shows that they are involved in key host cellular processes related to cell cycle regulation, proliferation, protein degradation, apoptosis, and immune responses. A focused analysis of transcription factors that directly interact with the predicted DENV-NS5 interacting proteins was performed, followed by the identification of downstream genes that are differentially expressed after dengue infection using previously published RNA-seq data. Our study provides unique insights into the DENV-NS5 interaction network and delineates mechanisms whereby DENV-NS5 could impact the host-virus interface. The novel interactors identified in this study could be potentially targeted by NS5 to modulate the host cellular environment in general, and the immune response in particular, thereby extending the role of DENV-NS5 beyond its known enzymatic functions.Supplementary information:The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-023-03569-0."""

Antiviral effects of salidroside were examined in DENV-infected cells by western blotting, flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Its underlying mechanism involved in antiviral action was determined by evaluating expression of host innate immune factors including RIG-I, IRF-3, IRF-7, PKR, P-eIF2α and NF-κB. Salidroside potently inhibited DENV infection by decreasing DENV envelope protein expression more than tenfold. Salidroside exerts its antiviral activity by increasing expression of RNA helicases such as RIG-I, thereby initiating a downstream signaling cascade that induces upregulation of IRF-3 and IRF-7. It prevents viral protein synthesis by increasing the expression of PKR and P-eIF2α while decreasing NF-κB expression. It was also found to induce the expression of IFN-α. In addition, the number of NK cells and CD8+T cells were also found to be increased by salidroside treatment in human PBMCs, which are important in limiting DENV replication during early stages of infection. The findings presented here suggest that salidroside exhibits antiviral activity against DENV by inhibiting viral protein synthesis and boosting host immunity by increasing the expression of host innate immune factors and hence could be considered for the development of an effective therapeutic agent against DENV infection."""

To better understand this important phenotype, we investigated the role of diet-induced nutritional stress on interference against DENV and the avian malarial parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum in Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti, and on physiological processes linked to the phenotype. Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were fed one of four different concentrations of sucrose, and then challenged with either P. gallinaceum or DENV. Interference against P. gallinaceum was significantly weakened by the change in diet however there was no effect on DENV interference. Immune gene expression and H2O2 levels have previously been linked to pathogen interference. These traits were assayed for mosquitoes on each diet using RT-qPCR and the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit, and it was observed that the change in diet did not significantly affect immune expression, but low carbohydrate levels led to a loss of ROS induction in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

Amongst these, the three DEAD-box RNA helicases AAEL004419/Dhx15, AAEL008728, and AAEL004859 also acted as antiviral factors in dengue and CHIKV infections. Here, we explored the mechanism of Dhx15 in regulating an antiviral transcriptional response in mosquitoes by silencing Dhx15 in Aag2 cells followed by deep-sequencing of poly-A enriched RNAs. Dhx15 knockdown in uninfected and CHIKV-infected cells resulted in differential expression of 856 and 372 genes, respectively. Interestingly, amongst the consistently downregulated genes, glycolytic process was the most enriched gene ontology (GO) term as the expression of all core enzymes of the glycolytic pathway was reduced, suggesting that Dhx15 regulates glycolytic function. A decrease in lactate production indicated that Dhx15 silencing indeed functionally impaired glycolysis. Modified rates of glycolytic metabolism have been implicated in controlling the replication of several classes of viruses and strikingly, infection of Aag2 cells with CHIKV by itself also resulted in the decrease of several glycolytic genes. Our data suggests that Dhx15 regulates replication of CHIKV, and possibly other arboviruses, by controlling glycolysis in mosquito cells."""

Several DENV proteins have been shown to target crucial human host proteins to evade innate immune responses and establish a productive infection. Here we report that the DENV NS3 protein targets RIPK1 (Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase I), a central mediator of inflammation and cell death, and decreases intracellular RIPK1 levels during DENV infection. The interaction of NS3 with RIPK1 results in the inhibition of NF-κB activation in response to TNFR or TLR3 stimulation. Also, we observed that the effects of NS3 on RIPK1 were independent of NS3 protease activity.

The recent reemergence and spread of flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), highlight the importance of performing basic research on this important group of pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and have been demonstrated to regulate a broad range of cellular processes. Our research is focused on identifying pro- and antiflaviviral miRNAs as a means of characterizing cellular pathways that support or limit viral replication. We have screened a library of known human miRNA mimics for their effect on the replication of three flaviviruses, DENV, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), using a high-content immunofluorescence screen. Several families of miRNAs were identified as inhibiting multiple flaviviruses, including the miRNA miR-34, miR-15, and miR-517 families. Members of the miR-34 family, which have been extensively characterized for their ability to repress Wnt/β-catenin signaling, demonstrated strong antiflaviviral effects, and this inhibitory activity extended to other viruses, including ZIKV, alphaviruses, and herpesviruses. Previous research suggested a possible link between the Wnt and type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFN induction in the antiviral effects of the miR-34 family and confirmed that these miRNAs potentiate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus, the induction of IFN-responsive genes, and the release of type I IFN from transfected cells. We further demonstrate that the intersection between the Wnt and IFN signaling pathways occurs at the point of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) binding, inducing TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF3 and initiate downstream IFN signaling. In this way, we have identified a novel cellular signaling network with a critical role in regulating the replication of multiple virus families. These findings highlight the opportunities for using miRNAs as tools to discover and characterize unique cellular factors involved in supporting or limiting virus replication, opening up new avenues for antiviral research.IMPORTANCEMicroRNAs are a class of small regulatory RNAs that modulate cellular processes through the posttranscriptional repression of multiple transcripts. We hypothesized that individual miRNAs may be capable of inhibiting viral replication through their effects on host proteins or pathways. To test this, we performed a high-content screen for miRNAs that inhibit the replication of three medically relevant members of the flavivirus family: West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus 2. The results of this screen identify multiple miRNAs that inhibit one or more of these viruses. Extensive follow-up on members of the miR-34 family of miRNAs, which are active against all three viruses as well as the closely related Zika virus, demonstrated that miR-34 functions through increasing the infected cell's ability to respond to infection through the interferon-based innate immune pathway. Our results not only add to the knowledge of how viruses interact with cellular pathways but also provide a basis for more extensive data mining by providing a comprehensive list of miRNAs capable of inhibiting flavivirus replication. Finally, the miRNAs themselves or cellular pathways identified as modulating virus infection may prove to be novel candidates for the development of therapeutic interventions."""

For instance, flavivirus infections were found to sabotage peroxisomes, organelles with an important role in innate immunity. The current model suggests that the capsid (C) proteins of DENV and ZIKV downregulate peroxisomes, ultimately resulting in reduced production of interferons by interacting with the host protein PEX19, a crucial chaperone in peroxisomal biogenesis. Here, we aimed to explore the importance of peroxisomes and the role of C interaction with PEX19 in the flavivirus life cycle. By infecting cells lacking peroxisomes we show that this organelle is required for optimal DENV replication. Moreover, we demonstrate that DENV and ZIKV C bind PEX19 through a conserved PEX19-binding motif, which is also commonly found in cellular peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). However, in contrast to PMPs, this interaction does not result in the targeting of C to peroxisomes. Furthermore, we show that the presence of C results in peroxisome loss due to impaired peroxisomal biogenesis, which appears to occur by a PEX19-independent mechanism. Hence, these findings challenge the current model of how flavivirus C might downregulate peroxisomal abundance and suggest a yet unknown role of peroxisomes in flavivirus biology."""

ER stress induces the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which compromises the stimulus and then determines whether the cell survives or dies. In recent years, ongoing research has suggested that these pathways may be linked to the autophagic response, which plays a key role in the cell's response to various stressors. Autophagy performs a self-digestion function, and its activation protects cells against certain pathogens. However, the link between the UPR and autophagy may be more complicated. These two systems may act dependently, or the induction of one system may interfere with the other. Experimental studies have found that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to escape the host immune response or, worse, to exploit the host's defense to their advantage; thus, this topic is a critical area in antiviral research. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about how RNA viruses, including influenza virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus, and dengue virus, regulate these processes. We also discuss recent discoveries and how these will produce novel strategies for antiviral treatment."""

This study aimed to characterize the classes and subclasses of antibody responses to a recombinant receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and investigated the reactivity of these antibodies in patients with other tropical infections and healthy individuals in Thailand. ELISAs for IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG subclasses based on RBD antigen were developed and tested with time series of 27 serum samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 and 60 samples from pre-COVID-19 outbreaks including acute dengue fever, murine typhus, influenza, leptospirosis and healthy individuals. Both RBD-specific IgA and IgG were detected in only 21% of the COVID-19 patients in the acute phase. The median IgA and IgG levels were significantly higher in the convalescent serum sample compared to the acute serum sample (P < 0.05). We observed the highest correlation between levels of IgG and IgA (rho = 0. 92). IgG1 and IgG3 were the major IgG subclasses detected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only acute IgG3 level was negatively associated with viral detection based on RT-PCR of ORF1ab gene (rho = -0.57). The median IgA and IgG levels in convalescence sera of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than healthy individuals and convalescent sera of other febrile infectious patients.

Chemical insecticide-based methods for mosquito control have increased resistance in different parts of the world. Thus, alternative control agents such as the entomopathogenic fungi are excellent candidates to control mosquitoes as part of an ecofriendly strategy. There is evidence of the potential of entomopathogenic fungal conidia and blastospores for biological control of eggs, larval and adult stages, as well as the pathogenicity of fungal microsclerotia against adults and eggs. However, there are no studies on the pathogenicity of microsclerotia against either aquatic insects or insects that develop part of their life cycle in the water, such as the A. aegypti larvae. In this study, we assayed the production of microsclerotia and their pathogenicity against A. aegypti larvae of two isolates of Metarhizium robertsii, i.e., CEP 423 isolated in La Plata, Argentina, and the model ARSEF 2575. Both isolates significantly reduced the survival of A. aegypti exposed to their microsclerotia. The fungus-larva interaction resulted in a delayed response in the host. This was evidenced by the expression of some humoral immune system genes such as defensins and cecropin on the 9th day post-infection, when the fungal infection was consolidated as a successful process that culminates in larvae mortality. In conclusion, M. robertsii microsclerotia are promising propagules to be applied as biological control agents against mosquitoes since they produce pathogenic conidia against A. aegypti larvae."""

Infection with an RNA virus activates receptors such as RIG-I, resulting in the recruitment of the adaptor protein MAVS to the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signalosome and the formation of prion-like functional aggregates of MAVS, which leads to IFN-β production. Here, we identified the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) as a previously uncharacterized IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) product with critical roles in the antiviral response. Knockout of ALDH1B1 increased, whereas overexpression of ALDH1B1 restricted, the replication of RNA viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and influenza A virus (IAV). We found that ALDH1B1 localized to mitochondria, where it interacted with the transmembrane domain of MAVS to promote MAVS aggregation. ALDH1B1 was recruited to MAVS aggregates. In addition, ALDH1B1 also enhanced the interaction between activated RIG-I and MAVS, thus increasing IFN-β production and the antiviral response. Furthermore,Aldh1b1-/-mice developed more severe symptoms than did wild-type mice upon IAV infection. Together, these data identify an aldehyde dehydrogenase in mitochondria that functionally regulates MAVS-mediated signaling and the antiviral response."""

Specifically, ZIKV infection induces kynurenine (Kyn) production, which activates AHR, limiting the production of type I interferons (IFN-I) involved in antiviral immunity. Moreover, ZIKV-triggered AHR activation suppresses intrinsic immunity driven by the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, which limits ZIKV replication. AHR inhibition suppressed the replication of multiple ZIKV strains in vitro and also suppressed replication of the related flavivirus dengue.

The drastic increase in the dengue infection could be partly attributed to geographic expansion of the vector due to increasing urbanization, unavailability of specific antiviral therapies, licensed dengue vaccine, and poor understanding of the host immune responses. It has been reported that the immune-dominant envelope protein (E protein) domain III region (EDIII) of DENV is one of the most potent vaccine candidates because of its ability to trigger host immunity by inducing production of protective neutralizing antibodies. However, its role in the modulation of innate inflammatory responses hitherto remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that EDIII protein of DENV induces pro-inflammatory signature by inducing production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α in THP-1 cells through NF-κB pathway. Also, we observed increase in the maturation of IL-1β, which was found to be associated with increased ROS production and potassium efflux. Further, our findings reveal that the IL-1β production by EDIII protein is mediated through caspase-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion this study unearths the role of DENV EDIII protein in modulating innate inflammatory responses, which might provide possible mechanism of pathogenesis and open-up new avenues for the development of therapeutics against DENV."""

Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) antagonizes mitophagy by binding to the host protein Ajuba and preventing its translocation to depolarized mitochondria where it is required for PINK1 activation and downstream signaling. Consequent mitophagy suppression amplifies the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines through protein kinase R (PKR) sensing of mitochondrial RNA. In Ajuba-/-mice, ZIKV induces early expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines associated with significantly enhanced dissemination to tissues.

Although a complete mechanistic understanding of pathogen blocking is lacking, it is likely to involve host immunity induction and resource competition between Wolbachia and DENV, both of which may be impacted by microbiome composition. The potential impact of Wolbachia transinfection on host fitness is also of importance given the widespread release of mosquitos infected with the Drosophila melanogaster strain of Wolbachia (wMel) in wild populations. Here, population-level genomic data from Ae. aegypti was surveyed to establish the relationship between the density of wMel infection and the composition of the host microbiome.Results:Analysis of genomic data from 172 Ae. aegypti females across six populations resulted in an expanded and quantitatively refined, species-level characterization of the bacterial, archaeal, and fungal microbiome. This included 844 species of bacteria across 23 phyla, of which 54 species were found to be ubiquitous microbiome members across these populations. The density of wMel infection was highly variable between individuals and negatively correlated with microbiome diversity. Network analyses revealed wMel as a hub comprised solely of negative interactions with other bacterial species. This contrasted with the large and highly interconnected network of other microbiome species that may represent members of the midgut microbiome community in this population.Conclusion:Our bioinformatic survey provided a species-level characterization of Ae. aegypti microbiome composition and variation. wMel load varied substantially across populations and individuals and, importantly, wMel was a major hub of a negative interactions across the microbiome. These interactions may be an inherent consequence of heightened pathogen blocking in densely infected individuals or, alternatively, may result from antagonistic Wolbachia-incompatible bacteria that could impede the efficacy of wMel as a biological control agent in future applications. The relationship between wMel infection variation and the microbiome warrants further investigation in the context of developing wMel as a multivalent control agent against other arboviruses.

Sampling of the microbiome of axenic flies fed with equal proportions of both bacteria shows that the presence ofWolbachiabacteria is a significant determinant of the composition of the microbiome throughout fly development. However, this effect is host genotype dependent. To investigate the mechanism of microbiome modulation, the effect ofWolbachiabacteria on Imd and reactive oxygen species pathways, the main regulators of immune response in the fly gut, was measured.

Furthermore, microbiome modulation is not due to direct interaction betweenWolbachiabacteria and gut microbes. Confocal analysis shows thatWolbachiabacteria are absent from the gut lumen. These results indicate that the mechanistic basis of the modulation of composition of the microbiome byWolbachiabacteria is more complex than a direct bacterial interaction or the effect ofWolbachiabacteria on fly immunity.

Here, we show that a unique, abundant, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), present in Francisella, contributes to driving the suppression of inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells.

Many are human pathogens that inflict a socio-economic burden. Interestingly, plus-strand RNA viruses share remarkable similarities in their replication. A hallmark of plus-strand RNA viruses is the remodeling of intracellular membranes to establish replication organelles (so-called """"replication factories""""), which provide a protected environment for the replicase complex, consisting of the viral genome and proteins necessary for viral RNA synthesis. In the current study, we investigate pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences in the life cycle of this highly relevant group of viruses. We first measured the kinetics of viral RNA, viral protein, and infectious virus particle production of hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in the immuno-compromised Huh7 cell line and thus without perturbations by an intrinsic immune response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailed mathematical model of the replication of HCV, DENV, and CVB3 and show that only small virus-specific changes in the model were necessary to describe thein vitrodynamics of the different viruses. Our model correctly predicted virus-specific mechanisms such as host cell translation shut off and different kinetics of replication organelles. Further, our model suggests that the ability to suppress or shut down host cell mRNA translation may be a key factor forin vitroreplication efficiency which may determine acute self-limited or chronic infection. We further analyzed potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatment optionsin silicoand found that targeting viral RNA translation, especially polyprotein cleavage, and viral RNA synthesis may be the most promising drug targets for all plus-strand RNA viruses. Moreover, we found that targeting only the formation of replicase complexes did not stop the viral replicationin vitroearly in infection, while inhibiting intracellular trafficking processes may even lead to amplified viral growth.Author summary:Plus-strand RNA viruses comprise a large group of related and medically relevant viruses. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-coronavirus-2 as well as the constant spread of diseases such as dengue and chikungunya fever show the necessity of a comprehensive and precise analysis of plus-strand RNA virus infections. Plus-strand RNA viruses share similarities in their life cycle. To understand their within-host replication strategies, we developed a mathematical model that studies pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences of three plus-strand RNA viruses, namely hepatitis C, dengue, and coxsackievirus. By fitting our model toin vitrodata, we found that only small virus-specific variations in the model were required to describe the dynamics of all three viruses.

These cytokines orchestrate the elimination of the viruses but are occasionally detrimental to the hosts. The outcomes and pathogenesis of viral infection are largely determined by the specific interaction between the viruses and their host cells. Therefore, compounds that either inhibit viral infection or modulate virus-induced cytokine response should be considered as candidates for managing virus infection. The aim of the study was to identify compounds in both categories, using a single cell-based assay. Our screening platform is a HEK293 cell-based reporter assay where the expression of a firefly luciferase is under the control of a human IFN-β promoter. We have demonstrated that infection of the reporter cell line with a panel of RNA viruses activated the reporter gene expression that correlates quantitatively with the levels of virus replication and progeny virus production, and could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by known antiviral compound or inhibitors of PRR signal transduction pathways. Using Dengue virus as an example, a pilot screening of a small molecule library consisting of 26,900 compounds proved the concept that the IFN-β promoter reporter assay can serve as a convenient high throughput screening platform for simultaneous discovery of antiviral and innate immune response modulating compounds. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6-ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl) urea, was demonstrated to specifically inhibit several viruses belonging to the family of flaviviridae."""

Wolbachia does not naturally infect Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus, but transinfected Ae. aegypti have antidengue virus properties and are currently being trialled as a dengue biocontrol strategy. Here, we assess the impact of Wolbachia infection of Ae. aegypti on the microbiome of wild mosquito populations (adults and larvae) collected from release sites in Cairns, Australia, by profiling the 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Our data indicate that Wolbachia reduces the relative abundance of a large proportion of bacterial taxa in Ae. aegypti adults, that is in accordance with the known pathogen-blocking effects of Wolbachia on a variety of bacteria and viruses. In adults, several of the most abundant bacterial genera were found to undergo significant shifts in relative abundance. However, the genera showing the greatest changes in relative abundance in Wolbachia-infected adults represented a low proportion of the total microbiome. In addition, there was little effect of Wolbachia infection on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in larvae, or on species diversity (accounting for species richness and evenness together) detected in adults or larvae. These results offer insight into the effects of Wolbachia on the Ae. aegypti microbiome in a native setting, an important consideration for field releases of Wolbachia into the population."""

In recent years Ebola, Zika, influenza, and chikungunya virus epidemics have raised awareness that infections can spread rapidly before vaccines or specific antagonists can be made available. Broad-spectrum antivirals are drugs with the potential to inhibit infection by viruses from different groups or families, which may be deployed during outbreaks when specific diagnostics, vaccines or directly acting antivirals are not available. While pathogen-directed approaches are generally effective against a few closely related viruses, targeting cellular pathways used by multiple viral agents can have broad-spectrum efficacy. Virus entry, particularly clathrin-mediated endocytosis, constitutes an attractive target as it is used by many viruses. Using a phenotypic screening strategy where the inhibitory activity of small molecules was sequentially tested against different viruses, we identified 12 compounds with broad-spectrum activity, and found a subset blocking viral internalisation and/or fusion. Importantly, we show that compounds identified with this approach can reduce viral replication in a mouse model of Zika infection.

The study enrolled 88 dengue patients, 31 OFI cases, and 63 healthy individuals as controls. Out of 88 dengue cases, 32 were classified as severe dengue cases (SD) and remaining 56 patients as non-severe dengue (NSD). Blood samples were collected firstly at the time of admission and a second sampling was done from the available individuals (38 dengue and 13 OFI cases) at the time of defervescence. Total RNA was extracted from the Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the transcripts level of Nox-2 and Nrf2 were analysed by qPCR. On DOA, both Nox-2 and Nrf2 expression was found to be down regulated in dengue and OFI cases (P< 0.05) compared to healthy controls. Interestingly at defervescence, the transcript levels were found to be significantly increased in dengue cases unlike OFI, where no such increment was evidenced. From DOA to DOD, the study observed a signficant increase in the levels of Nox-2 transcripts (P< 0.05) both in SD and NSD cases. But a significant Nrf2 activation was not observed in SD cases as we found in NSD cases. Thus a steady and significant increase in Nox-2 transcript level in severe, non-severe and secondary dengue infected groups observed in the current study supports the earlier reports on the involvement of anti-oxidant response in dengue severity.

Because these viruses all depend on the mosquito as a vector for disease transmission, current research has focused on identifying immune mechanisms used by insects to effectively harbor these viruses and cause disease in humans and other animals.Drosophila melanogasterare a vital model to study arboviral infections and host responses as they are a genetically malleable model organism for experimentation that can complement analysis in the virus' natural vectors.D. melanogasterencode a number of distinct mechanisms of antiviral defense that are found in both mosquito and vertebrate animal systems, providing a viable model for study. These pathways include canonical antiviral modules such as RNA interference (RNAi), JAK/STAT signaling, and the induction of STING-mediated immune responses like autophagy.

The exact mechanisms of insulin-mediated immune responses vary with each virus type, but nevertheless ultimately demonstrates that metabolic and immune signaling are coupled for antiviral immunity in an arthropod model.

Owing to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), secondary infection with oneFlavivirusfollowing primary infection with anotherFlaviviruscan result in a significantly larger peak viral load with a much higher risk of severe disease. Although several mathematical models have been developed to quantify the virus dynamics in the primary and secondary infections of DENV, little progress has been made regarding secondary infection of DENV after a primary infection of ZIKV, or DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Here, we address this critical gap by developing compartmental models of virus dynamics. We first fitted the models to published data on dengue viral loads of the primary and secondary infections with the observation that the primary infection reaches its peak much more gradually than the secondary infection. We then quantitatively show that ADE is the key factor determining a sharp increase/decrease of viral load near the peak time in the secondary infection. In comparison, our simulations of DENV and ZIKV co-infection (simultaneous rather than sequential) show that ADE has very limited influence on the peak DENV viral load. This indicates pre-existing immunity to ZIKV is the determinant of a high level of ADE effect. Our numerical simulations show that (i) in the absence of ADE effect, a subsequent co-infection is beneficial to the second virus; and (ii) if ADE is feasible, then a subsequent co-infection can induce greater damage to the host with a higher peak viral load and a much earlier peak time for the second virus, and for the second peak for the first virus."""

Innate immune activation by Nod-like receptors (NLRs) is a critical part of host defense against viral infection. Here, we revealed a key mechanism of NLRP12-mediated regulation in DENV infection. Firstly, NLRP12 expression was inhibited in human macrophage following DENV or other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection. Positive regulatory domain 1 (PRDM1) was induced by DENV or poly(I:C) and suppressed NLRP12 expression, which was dependent on TBK-1/IRF3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, NLRP12 inhibited DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) replication, which relied on the well-conserved nucleotide binding structures of its NACHT domain. Furthermore, NLRP12 could interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) dependent on its Walker A and Walker B sites. In addition, NLRP12 enhanced the production of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3, TRAIL and Viperin. Inhibition of HSP90 with 17-DMAG impaired the upregulation of type I IFNs and ISGs induced by NLRP12. Taken together, we demonstrated a novel mechanism that NLRP12 exerted anti-viral properties in DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection, which brings up a potential target for the treatment of DENV infection."""

Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two divergent arboviruses: dengue virus-2 (DENV-2; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae, Alphavirus). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection, we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin-1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for both viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells. Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means."""

The main objective was to investigate the molecular responses of Cx. pipiens to RVFV exposure focusing mainly on genes implicated in innate immune responses. Mosquitoes were fed with blood spiked with RVFV. The fully-engorged females were pooled at 3 different time points: 2 hours post-exposure (hpe), 3- and 14-days post-exposure (dpe). Pools of mosquitoes fed with non-infected blood were also collected for comparisons. Total RNA from each mosquito pool was subjected to RNA-seq analysis and a de novo transcriptome was constructed. A total of 451 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified. Most of the transcriptomic alterations were found at an early infection stage after RVFV exposure. Forty-eight DEG related to immune infection-response were characterized. Most of them were related with the RNAi system, Toll and IMD pathways, ubiquitination pathway and apoptosis.

This mosquito-borne virus disease is endemic in over 100 countries and will probably continue spreading, given the observed trend in global warming. So far, there is no antiviral drug available against dengue, but a vaccine has been recently marketed. Dengue virus also serves as a prototype for the study of other pathogenic flaviviruses that are emerging, like West Nile virus and Zika virus. Upon viral entry into the host cell and fusion of the viral lipid membrane with the endosomal membrane, the viral RNA is released and expressed as a polyprotein, that is then matured into three structural and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. The envelope, membrane and capsid proteins form the viral particle while NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B and NS5 assemble inside a cellular replication complex, which is embedded in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles. In addition to their roles in RNA replication within the infected cell, NS proteins help the virus escape the host innate immunity and reshape the host-cell inner structure. This review focuses on recent progress in characterizing the structure and functions of NS5, a protein responsible for the replication and capping of viral RNA that represents a promising drug target."""

Currently, there is no antiviral treatment to diminish severe illness or a vaccine to induce protection from infection. An effective dengue vaccine that protects against all four DENV serotypes is a high priority for endemic countries and several candidates are in development by various United States Federal Agencies and private pharmaceutical companies. Challenges faced by dengue vaccine developers include creating tetravalent formulations that provide tetravalent protection, the lack of a correlate of protective immunity, a changing viral landscape as DENV evolves, and a complex viral-host pathogenesis that can result in a spectrum of illness from subclinical infection to severe hemorrhagic fever. There have been a number of long-term prospective studies on DENV transmission and dengue severity that have provided invaluable information on DENV epidemiology and pathogenesis of this disease.

The release ofWolbachiainto wild populations of mosquitoes is an innovative biocontrol effort to suppress the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) to humans, most notably dengue virus. The success of theWolbachia-based approach hinges upon the stable persistence of the 'pathogen blocking' effect, whose mechanistic basis is poorly understood. Evidence suggests thatWolbachiamay affect viral replication via a combination of competition for host resources and activation of host immunity. The evolution of resistance againstWolbachiaand pathogen blocking in the mosquito or the virus could reduce the public health impact of the symbiont releases. Here, we investigate if dengue 3 virus (DENV-3) is capable of accumulating adaptive mutations that improve its replicative capacity during serial passage inWolbachia wMel-infected cells. During the passaging regime, viral isolates inWolbachia-infected cells exhibited greater variation in viral loads compared to controls. The viral loads of these isolates declined rapidly during passaging due to the blocking effects ofWolbachiacarriage, with several being lost all together and the remainder recovering to low but stable levels. We attempted to sequence the genomes of the surviving passaged isolates but, given their low abundance, were unable to obtain sufficient depth of coverage for evolutionary analysis. In contrast, viral loads inWolbachia-free control cells were consistently high during passaging. The surviving isolates passaged in the presence ofWolbachiaexhibited a reduced ability to replicate even inWolbachia-free cells. These experiments demonstrate the challenge for dengue in evolving resistance toWolbachia-mediated blocking."""

The effort to understand the complex interactions of ZIKV with cellular networks contributes to the identification of novel host-directed antiviral (HDA) candidates. Among the cellular pathways involved in infection, lipid metabolism gains attention. In ZIKV-infected cells lipid metabolism attributed to intracellular membrane remodeling, virion morphogenesis, autophagy modulation, innate immunity and inflammation. The key roles played by the cellular structures associated with lipid metabolism, such as peroxisomes and lipid droplets, are starting to be deciphered. Consequently, there is a wide variety of lipid-related antiviral strategies that are currently under consideration, which include an inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), the activation of adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), an inhibition of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), interference with sphingolipid metabolism, blockage of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or a treatment with cholesterol derivatives. Remarkably, most of the HDAs identified in these studies are also effective against flaviviruses other than ZIKV (West Nile virus and dengue virus), supporting their broad-spectrum effect. Considering that lipid metabolism is one of the main cellular pathways suitable for pharmacological intervention, the idea of repositioning drugs targeting lipid metabolism as antiviral candidates is gaining force."""

Recently, MCPIP1 has also been identified as a host antiviral factor against certain virus infection including human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus and hepatitis C virus. However, whether MCPIP1 could restrict the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA pararetrovirus belonging to Hepadnaviridae family, has not been investigated. In this study, we found that MCPIP1 expression was up-regulated in mouse livers upon acute HBV replication and in HBV-replicated hepatoma cells or HBV-stimulated macrophages. Enforced MCPIP1 expression by hydrodynamic DNA injection in vivo significantly inhibited HBV replication in the mouse livers. Then in vitro studies by overexpression or knockdown assays in cell-lines identified the direct antiviral effect of MCPIP1 on HBV replication. RNA immunoprecipitation and decay assay further suggested that MCPIP1 potently restricted HBV replication through directly binding viral RNA and degrading RNA via its RNase activity, but not deubiquitinase activity. Moreover, we further verified that MCPIP1 negatively regulated HBV-induced proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in macrophages. Taken together, our data expand MCPIP1's range of viral targets to DNA virus and also demonstrate the negative regulatory role of MCPIP1 in suppressing virus-induced inflammatory response, suggesting MCPIP1 as a potential therapeutic target for treating HBV-related diseases via inducing a host defense against HBV and reducing inflammatory injury meanwhile."""

We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-κB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-β in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling.Methodology/principal findings:We used quantitative RT-PCR and found that only low levels of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA were detected in DENV-2-infected bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-κB activation by p65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-κB activation triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection.Conclusions/significance:To downregulate the host innate immunity, DENV-2 by itself is a weak inducer of type I IFN and cytokines, furthermore DENV-2 can also block the TLR-triggered ERK-NF-κB activation and cytokine production."""

Furthermore, suppression of IκBα mediates the enhancing effect of miR-30e* on IFN-β-induced antiviral response. Collectively, our findings suggest a modulatory role of miR-30e* in DENV induced IFN-β signaling via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether miR-30e* has an anti-DENV effect in vivo."""

There is a consensus regarding the importance of developing a vaccine to control this disease. Despite many efforts to develop a protective vaccine against CVL, the ones currently available, Leish-tec®and LetiFend®, have limited effectiveness. This is due, in part, to the complexity of the immune response of the naturally infected dogs against the parasite and the complexity of the parasite transmission cycle. Thus, strategies, such as the development of a transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) already being applied to other vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, would be an attractive alternative to control leishmaniasis. TBVs induce the production of antibodies in the vertebrate host, which can inhibit parasite development in the vector and/or interfere with aspects of vector biology, leading to an interruption of parasite transmission. To date, there are few TBV studies for CVL and other leishmaniasis forms. However, the few studies that exist show promising results, thus justifying the further development of this approach."""

The recent rapid spread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted mainly by the mosquitoAedes aegypti, which is also the vector of dengue virus; however, little is known about the interactions of the virus with the mosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of wholeA. aegyptimosquitoes in response to ZIKV infection at 2, 7, and 14 days postinfection using transcriptome sequencing. Results showed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at each time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly changed among the three time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the altered genes are involved in metabolic processes, cellular processes, and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic noncoding RNAs that were altered upon ZIKV infection were identified. Further, we found changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes correlating with those of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic understanding ofA. aegyptiresponses to ZIKV and help to determine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host antiviral response against the virus.IMPORTANCEVector-borne viruses pose great risks to human health. Zika virus has recently emerged as a global threat, rapidly expanding its distribution. Understanding the interactions of the virus with mosquito vectors at the molecular level is vital for devising new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission. In this study, we embarked on analyzing the transcriptional response ofAedes aegyptimosquitoes to Zika virus infection. Results showed large changes in both coding and long noncoding RNAs. Analysis of these genes showed similarities with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector.

Antibodies are a significant component of the host's protective response against flavivirus infection with the potential to contribute to immunity via several distinct mechanisms, including an ability to directly neutralize virus infection. Conversely, virus-reactive antibodies have been implicated in the increased risk of severe clinical manifestations following secondary dengue virus infection. In this review, we will discuss recent progress toward understanding the molecular basis of antibody-mediated neutralization of flaviviruses. Neutralization requires engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that exceeds a required threshold.

To better understand their diversity, evolutionary history, and genomic flexibility, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to search for the viruses related to the Flaviviridae in a range of potential invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Accordingly, we recovered the full genomes of five segmented jingmenviruses and 12 distant relatives of the known Flaviviridae (""""flavi-like"""" viruses) from a range of arthropod species. Although these viruses are highly divergent, they share a similar genomic plan and common ancestry with the Flaviviridae in the NS3 and NS5 regions. Remarkably, although these viruses fill in major gaps in the phylogenetic diversity of the Flaviviridae, genomic comparisons reveal important changes in genome structure, genome size, and replication/gene regulation strategy during evolutionary history. In addition, the wide diversity of flavi-like viruses found in invertebrates, as well as their deep phylogenetic positions, suggests that they may represent the ancestral forms from which the vertebrate-infecting viruses evolved. For the vertebrate viruses, we expanded the previously mammal-only pegivirus-hepacivirus group to include a virus from the graceful catshark (Proscyllium habereri), which in turn implies that these viruses possess a larger host range than is currently known. In sum, our data show that the Flaviviridae infect a far wider range of hosts and exhibit greater diversity in genome structure than previously anticipated.Importance:The family Flaviviridae of RNA viruses contains several notorious human pathogens, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus. To date, however, our understanding of the biodiversity and evolution of the Flaviviridae has largely been directed toward vertebrate hosts and their blood-feeding arthropod vectors. Therefore, we investigated an expanded group of potential arthropod and vertebrate host species that have generally been ignored by surveillance programs. Remarkably, these species contained diverse flaviviruses and related viruses that are characterized by major changes in genome size and genome structure, such that these traits are more flexible than previously thought. More generally, these data suggest that arthropods may be the ultimate reservoir of the Flaviviridae and related viruses, harboring considerable genetic and phenotypic diversity.

Although mosquito surveillance regularly takes place in urban areas of Kenya, for example identifying vectors of dengue virus or malaria viruses, little work has been carried out to determine the distribution and abundance of sylvatic vectors. Here, we describe the mosquito vector species and diversity collected at twelve forest habitats of rural Kenya. We conducted arbovirus screening of over 14,082 mosquitoes (47 species, 11 genera) as 1520 pools, and detected seven viruses (six bunyaviruses, and one flavivirus-bunyavirus co-infection) isolated from pools ofAedes dentatus,Anopheles funestus,Culex annulioris,andCx. vansomereni. Awareness of sylvatic vector species and their location is a critical part of understanding the ecological foci and enzootic cycling of pathogens that may be of concern to public, animal or wildlife health.

We have previously reported the generation of axenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of several human pathogenic viruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus. In order to better understand the influence of the microbiome on mosquitoes, we examined the transcriptomes of axenic and conventionally reared Ae. aegypti before and after a blood meal. Our results suggest that the microbiome has a much lower effect on the mosquito's gene expression than previously thought with only 170 genes influenced by the axenic state, while in contrast, blood meal status influenced 809 genes. The pattern of expression influenced by the microbiome is consistent with transient changes similar to infection rather than sweeping physiological changes.

Here, we successfully transferred a wMel variant (termed wMelM) originating from a field-collected D. melanogaster into Ae. aegypti. The new wMelM variant (clade I) is genetically distinct from the original wMel transinfection (clade III), and there are no genomic differences between wMelM in its original and transinfected host. We compared wMelM with wMel in its effects on host fitness, temperature tolerance, Wolbachia density, vector competence, cytoplasmic incompatibility and maternal transmission under heat stress in a controlled background. wMelM showed a higher heat tolerance than wMel, likely due to higher overall densities within the mosquito. Both wMel variants had minimal host fitness costs, complete cytoplasmic incompatibility and maternal transmission, and dengue virus blocking under laboratory conditions.

Thus, we constructed an IgG-Fc vaccine platform for dengue, termed D-PCF, which in addition to a dengue antigen incorporates the cholera toxin non-toxic B subunit (CTB) as a molecular adjuvant, with all three proteins expressed as a single polypeptide. Following expression in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, the D-PCF assembled as polymeric structures of similar size to human IgM, a process driven by the pentamerization of CTB. A marked improvement of functional properties in vitro and immunogenicity in vivo over a previous iteration of the Fc-fusion protein without CTB [1] was demonstrated. These include enhanced antigen presenting cell binding, internalization and activation, complement activation, epithelial cell interactions and ganglioside binding, as well as more efficient polymerization within the expression host.

This is not only because the vectors bionomics are strongly dependent upon these variables, but also because most of the elements of the systems are impacted, such as the host behavior and development and the pathogen amplification. The impact of the climate changes on the transmission patterns of these diseases is not easily understood, since many confounding factors are acting together. Consequently, knowledge of these impacts is often based on hypothesis derived from mathematical models. Nevertheless, some direct evidences can be found for several vector-borne diseases.Main body:Evidences of the impact of climate change are available for malaria, arbovirus diseases such as dengue, and many other parasitic and viral diseases such as Rift Valley Fever, Japanese encephalitis, human African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. The effect of temperature and rainfall change as well as extreme events, were found to be the main cause for outbreaks and are alarming the global community. Among the main driving factors, climate strongly influences the geographical distribution of insect vectors, which is rapidly changing due to climate change. Further, in both models and direct evidences, climate change is seen to be affecting vector-borne diseases more strikingly in fringe of different climatic areas often in the border of transmission zones, which were once free of these diseases with human populations less immune and more receptive. The impact of climate change is also more devastating because of the unpreparedness of Public Health systems to provide adequate response to the events, even when climatic warning is available. Although evidences are strong at the regional and local levels, the studies on impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases and health are producing contradictory results at the global level.Conclusions:In this paper we discuss the current state of the results and draw on evidences from malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases to illustrate the state of current thinking and outline the need for further research to inform our predictions and response."""

Knock-out, silencing and mutagenesis of genes in the exogenous siRNA (exo-siRNA) regulatory network demonstrate the importance of this RNAi pathway in antiviral immunity in Drosophila and mosquitoes. In Drosophila, genes encoding components for processing exo-siRNAs are among the fastest evolving 3% of all genes, suggesting that infection with pathogenic RNA viruses may drive diversifying selection in their host. In contrast, paralogous miRNA pathway genes do not evolve more rapidly than the genome average.

Using this approach, we generated support for several published predicted transmembrane and enzymatic domains. Next, we created 7 mutants containing the 15-nucleotide insertion from the original selection and found 6 of them were capable of replication in both mammalian and mosquito tissue culture cells. Interestingly, one mutation had a significant impairment of viral assembly, and this mutation may lead to a better understanding of viral assembly and release. In addition, we created a fully infectious virus expressing a functionally tagged NS4B protein, which will provide a much-needed tool to elucidate the role of NS4B in viral pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEDengue virus is a mosquito-borne virus distributed in tropical and subtropical regions globally that can result in hospitalization and even death in some cases. Although a vaccine exists, its limitations and a lack of approved antiviral treatments highlight our limited understanding of dengue virus pathogenesis and host immunity. The functions of many viral proteins are poorly understood. We used a previously published approach using transposon mutagenesis to develop tools to study these proteins' functions by adding insertions randomly throughout the viral genomes. These genomes were transferred into cells, and infectious progeny were recovered to determine sites that tolerated insertions, as only the genomes that tolerated insertions would be able to propagate. Using these results, we created viruses with epitope tags, one in the viral structural protein Capsid and one in the viral nonstructural protein NS4B. Further investigation of these mutants may elucidate the roles of Capsid and NS4B during dengue virus infections."""

Here, we propose a novel avenue which is integration of a promoterless shmiRNA, i.e. a shRNA embedded in a micro-RNA (miRNA) scaffold, into an engineered genomic miRNA locus. For proof-of-concept, we used TALE or CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases to site-specifically integrate an anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) shmiRNA into the liver-specific miR-122/hcr locus in hepatoma cells, with the aim to obtain cellular clones that are genetically protected against HCV infection. Using reporter assays, Northern blotting and qRT-PCR, we confirmed anti-HCV shmiRNA expression as well as miR-122 integrity and functionality in selected cellular progeny. Moreover, we employed a comprehensive battery of PCR, cDNA/miRNA profiling and whole genome sequencing analyses to validate targeted integration of a single shmiRNA molecule at the expected position, and to rule out deleterious effects on the genomes or transcriptomes of the engineered cells. Importantly, a subgenomic HCV replicon and a full-length reporter virus, but not a Dengue virus control, were significantly impaired in the modified cells. Our original combination of DNA engineering and RNAi expression technologies benefits numerous applications, from miRNA, genome and transgenesis research, to human gene therapy."""

Ubiquitin modifications of host and viral proteins significantly influence the progress of virus infection. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2s (UBE2) have the capacity to determine ubiquitin chain topology and emerge as key mediators of chain assembly.Methods:In this study, we screened the functions of 34 E2 genes using an RNAi library during Dengue virus (DENV) infection. RNAi and gene overexpression approaches were used to study the gene function in viral infection and interferon signaling.Results:We found that silencing UBE2J1 significantly impaired DENV infection, while overexpression of UBE2J1 enhanced DENV infection. Further studies suggested that type I IFN expression was significantly increased in UBE2J1 silenced cells and decreased in UBE2J1 overexpressed cells. Reporter assay suggested that overexpression of UBE2J1 dramatically suppressed RIG-I directed IFNβ promoter activation.

It is estimated that approximately 30,000 people die each year of this disease. The liver is the main target of YFV, where as many as 80% of the hepatocytes may become involved in the infection. The overwhelming infection of the liver is associated with the observed hemorrhagic disease manifestations such as petechiae, ecchymoses, and hematemesis which are all thought to be linked with the observed coagulation abnormalities that include prolonged clotting times, reduction in clotting factors, fibrin-split products (D-dimers) and elevated prothrombin times. Many factors involved in the coagulation pathway are produced by hepatocytes, such as fibrinogen (FBG) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).

The VBFVs include those transmitted by mosquitos, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus; and those transmitted by ticks including the tick-borne flavivirus serocomplex and Powassan virus (POWV). Two of our recent reports showed that intracranial POWV infection in the reservoir host,Peromyscus leucopus, was restricted and caused no overt clinical disease. Several modes of analyses suggested activation of the LXR pathway. Activation of the LXR pathway leads to increased efflux of cholesterol from cells and consequent disturbances in membrane biogenesis. Because VBFV replication is dependent on membrane biogenesis, we evaluated the effect of an LXR agonist (LXR623) on POWV and ZIKV infection and observed that the compound impaired permissive replication of both viruses in a human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. The LXR agonist resulted in failure of the viruses to induce ER expansion and elaborate vesicle formation, suggesting that the efflux of cholesterol was part of the antiviral mechanism. We also observed that the LXR agonist contributed to the mechanism of virus suppression by increased expression of mRNAs encoding for the antiviral cytokines CXCL10, RANTES and IFN1β. In sharp contrast, a LXR antagonist (GSK2033) had no significant effect on VBFV replication. We conclude that LXR623 impairs flavivirus replication by stimulating cellular antiviral factors."""

The Inflammatory mediators and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The NF-κB nulcear translocation and protein expression of iNOS, COX-2 was analyzed with westernblot.Results:KSK supplementation decreased LPS mediated TLR-4 production and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2 and PGE-2. Moreover, it inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO) and thereby inhibited the expression of iNOS in the cell. The Western blot analysis further confirmed that KSK strongly prevented the LPS-induced degradation of IκB which is normally required for the activation of NF-κB and hereby suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The protein expression of iNOS, COX-2 was significantly decreased with the presence of KSK treatment.

In this study, MEK2 was identified as a novel binding partner of the E2 protein of CSFV using yeast two-hybrid screening. The E2-MEK2 interaction was confirmed by glutathioneS-transferase pulldown, coimmunoprecipitation, and laser confocal microscopy assays. The C termini of E2 (amino acids [aa] 890 to 1053) and MEK2 (aa 266 to 400) were mapped to be crucial for the interaction. Overexpression of MEK2 significantly promoted the replication of CSFV, whereas knockdown of MEK2 by lentivirus-mediated small hairpin RNAs dramatically inhibited CSFV replication. In addition, CSFV infection induced a biphasic activation of ERK1/2, the downstream signaling molecules of MEK2. Furthermore, the replication of CSFV was markedly inhibited in PK-15 cells treated with U0126, a specific inhibitor for MEK1/2/ERK1/2, whereas MEK2 did not affect CSFV replication after blocking the interferon-induced Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway by ruxolitinib, a JAK-STAT-specific inhibitor.

There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral treatments for flaviviral infections. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify host and viral factors that can be targeted for effective therapeutic intervention. Type I interferon (IFN-I) production in response to microbial products is one of the host's first line of defense against invading pathogens. Cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) is a type I interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that exerts antiviral effects. However, the molecular mechanism by which CMPK2 inhibits viral replication is unclear. Here, we report that CMPK2 expression restricts Zika virus (ZIKV) replication by specifically inhibiting viral translation and that IFN-I- induced CMPK2 contributes significantly to the overall antiviral response against ZIKV. We demonstrate that expression of CMPK2 results in a significant decrease in the replication of other pathogenic flaviviruses including dengue virus (DENV-2), Kunjin virus (KUNV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Importantly, we determine that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CMPK2, which lacks kinase activity, is sufficient to restrict viral translation. Thus, its kinase function is not required for CMPK2's antiviral activity. Furthermore, we identify seven conserved cysteine residues within the NTD as critical for CMPK2 antiviral activity. Thus, these residues may form an unknown functional site in the NTD of CMPK2 contributing to its antiviral function. Finally, we show that mitochondrial localization of CMPK2 is required for its antiviral effects.

Thus, we performed a comprehensive analysis of alterations in host poly-(A)/miRNA/lncRNA expression upon TBEV infectionin vitroin human primary neurons (high cytopathic effect) and astrocytes (low cytopathic effect).

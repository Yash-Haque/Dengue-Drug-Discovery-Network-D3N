If no value is provided, will default to VERY_LARGE_INTEGER (int(1e30)).\n",

        "* **split_special_tokens** (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether or not the special tokens should be split during the tokenization process. The default behavior is to not split special tokens. This means that if <s> is the bos_token, then tokenizer.tokenize(\"<s>\") = ['<s>]. Otherwise, if split_special_tokens=True, then tokenizer.tokenize(\"<s>\") will be give ['<', 's', '>']. This argument is only supported for slow tokenizers for the moment.\n",

Recent studies with human anti-bodies indicate that type-speciﬁc antibodies at high concentrations are often strongly neutralizing in vitro and protective in ani-\\nmal models. In general, cross-reactive antibodies are poorly neutralizing and can enhance the ability of DENV to infect Fcreceptor-bearing cells under some conditions. Type-speciﬁc antibodies at low concentrations also may enhance infection. Thereis an urgent need to determine whether there are conserved antigenic sites that can be recognized by cross-reactive potently neu-tralizing antibodies. Here, we describe the isolation of a large panel of naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies(MAbs) directed to the DENV domain II fusion loop (FL) envelope protein region from subjects following vaccination or naturalinfection. Most of the FL-speciﬁc antibodies exhibited a conventional phenotype, characterized by low-potency neutralizingfunction and antibody-dependent enhancing activity. One clone, however, recognized the bc loop of domain II adjacent to the FLand exhibited a unique phenotype of ultrahigh potency, neutralizing all four serotypes better than any other previously de-scribed MAb recognizing this region. This antibody not only neutralized DENV effectively but also competed for binding againstthe more prevalent poor-quality antibodies whose binding was focused on the FL. The 1C19 human antibody could be a promis-ing component of a preventative or therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the unique epitope revealed by 1C19 suggests a focusfor rational vaccine design based on novel immunogens presenting cross-reactive neutralizing determinants.\\nIMPORTANCE With no effective vaccine available, the incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections worldwide continues to rise,\\nwith more than 390 million infections estimated to occur each year. Due to the unique roles that antibodies are postulated toplay in the pathogenesis of DENV infection and disease, there is consensus that a successful DENV vaccine must protect againstall four serotypes. If conserved epitopes recognized by naturally occurring potently cross-neutralizing human antibodies couldbe identiﬁed, monovalent subunit vaccine preparations might be developed. We characterized 30 DENV cross-neutralizing hu-man monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and identiﬁed one (1C19) that recognized a novel conserved site, known as the bc loop. Thisantibody has several desirable features, as it neutralizes DENV effectively and competes for binding against the more commonlow-potency fusion loop (FL) antibodies, which are believed to contribute to antibody-mediated disease. To our knowledge, thisis the ﬁrst description of a potent serotype cross-neutralizing human antibody to DENV.\\nReceived 13 October 2013 Accepted 15 October 2013 Published 19 November 2013\\nCitation Smith SA, de Alwis AR, Kose N, Harris E, Ibarra KD, Kahle KM, Pfaff JM, Xiang X, Doranz BJ, de Silva AM, Austin SK, Sukupolvi-Petty S, Diamond MS, Crowe JE, Jr. 2013.

As aresult, the incidence of infections has risen steadily, with morethan 390 million infections estimated to occur annually (1), withincreasing numbers of the most severe form of dengue disease,\\ndengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or shock syndrome (DSS) (2).The mechanisms underlying severe dengue disease remain poorlyunderstood but may involve the pathogenic activities of cross-reactive antibodies (Abs). Following an initial primary infectionRESEARCH ARTICLE\\nNovember/December 2013 Volume 4 Issue 6 e00873-13®mbio.asm.org 1', 'Abstract': 'with DENV, lifelong antibody-mediated protection usually devel-\\nops against the homologous infecting serotype. However, the an-tibody response against DENV is dominated by a group of cross-reactive antibodies that bind to all four DENV serotypes. Thesecross-reactive antibodies are weakly neutralizing and generally donot protect against DENV infection when present at physiologicconcentrations, although at high concentrations some reduce vi-rus replication in semipermissive animal models. Moreover, themost widely accepted model of pathogenesis of severe dengue dis-ease proposes that with a subsequent infection by a different sero-type (known as a secondary infection), serotype cross-reactive an-tibodies form nonneutralized antigen-antibody complexes thatfacilitate the efﬁcient entry of the virus in to host cells expressingFc receptors. This enhanced uptake of virus into susceptible cells isproposed to result in increased viral replication and release ofcytokines and vasoactive mediators that alter vascular permeabil-ity. This process has been termed antibody-dependent enhance-ment (ADE) of infection and has been demonstrated to occurusing human immune serum or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)in cell culture and in animal models (3–6).\\nDENVs are members of the Flaviviridae family of single-\\nstranded positive-sense RNA viruses that have pseudoicosahedralsymmetry and display 180 copies of the envelope (E) glycoproteinand premembrane/membrane (prM/M) proteins, which are em-bedded in the lipid bilayer membrane. The immunodominant Eglycoprotein is comprised of three structural domains, designateddomain I (DI), DII, and DIII; E protein exists as a homodimer inthe prefusion state on the mature virus particle and undergoesmultiple conformational changes during maturation and fusion.Initial characterization of the targets of neutralizing antibodieswas performed using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) isolatedfrom mice (7–11); however, the ability to translate this informa-tion to the human immune response has been limited (12). Themajor antigenic targets of the neutralizing human antibody re-sponse have been studied using polyclonal serum from naturallyinfected patients (13, 14). Given the polyclonal nature of serum,however, the response to individual antibody epitopes has notbeen easy to parse out at the molecular level.\\nA comprehensive understanding of the location of antigenicsites targeted by the protective and/or pathogenic human anti-\\nbody response is of critical importance to vaccine developmentefforts against DENV. Over the past 3 years, several panels of hu-man MAbs have been characterized by multiple groups, showingthat the human response targets both E and prM protein and iscomprised largely of serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutral-izing antibodies (15–19). Only a small percentage of antibodies,/H1102110% of those directed against surface-exposed epitopes, are se-\\nrotype speciﬁc or potently inhibitory (neutralizing at a /H110210.5-\\n/H9262g/ml concentration). This natural scarcity of strongly neutraliz-\\ning antibodies has made it challenging to map the epitopestargeted by the protective human antibody response. Recently,studies using DENV immune serum depletion and human MAbtechniques suggested that the antibodies responsible for serumneutralizing activity following primary DENV infection may beserotype speciﬁc and likely target a site outside DIII, with MAbsrecognizing epitopes within the hinge region between DI and DIIon the E protein. Many of these antibodies bound quaternaryepitopes that existed only on the virion, and not on isolated Eproteins (13, 16). The structure of a virion-only binding antibody,in complex with DENV1, was recently determined using cryo-electron microscopy (20). These antibodies are quite potent butgenerally are serotype speciﬁc in their ability to bind DENV andneutralize infection.\\nIt remains unclear if immune humans can also generate anti-\\nbodies with potent cross-neutralizing properties. Several recentstudies suggested that naturally occurring anti-DENV humanantibodies with cross-neutralizing activity target the fusion loop(FL) epitope on DII of the E protein (DII-FL) (21–27). Theseantibodies, however, frequently exhibit only weak to moderatelyneutralizing activity (half-maximal effective concentrationneeded for neutralization [EC\\n50]o f1t o5 /H9262g/ml) and frequently\\ndisplay signiﬁcant ADE activity in vitro and in vivo (25). Sites\\ntargeted by potent serotype cross-neutralizing human antibodieshave not been described.\\nIn the present study, we assembled a large panel of MAbs, ob-\\ntained from human subjects following vaccination or primary andsecondary infection, to proﬁle the anti-DENV serotype cross-neutralizing antibody response.

One unusual clone (1C19), however,exhibited ultrahigh neutralization potency against DENV strainscorresponding to all four serotypes. Fine epitope mapping studiesrevealed that this MAb was distinct from the less potent DII-FLMAbs in that it targeted the conserved bc loop (amino acids [aa]73 to 79) adjacent to the FL. This antibody has several desirablefeatures, including both the ability to neutralize DENV effectivelyand the ability to compete for binding against the more commonlow-potency FL antibodies, which likely contribute to antibody-mediated disease. Therefore, elucidation of the features of thisunique epitope may inform the design of vaccines intended toelicit protective immunity with reduced capacity to induce anti-bodies that enhance infection.\\nRESULTS\\nHuman MAbs to the DII-FL region of DENV E protein. To study\\nthe human antibody response to DENV, we generated severalhundred MAbs from subjects following primary and secondaryDENV infection as well as recipients of a live attenuated vaccine(25). While characterizing these MAbs, we observed that a largesubset of DENV complex-reactive antibodies (those able to bindto viruses from all four serotypes) targeted the DII-FL region,some of which neutralized viruses from multiple DENV serotypes.\\nWe assembled a large panel of these MAbs from subjects followingnatural DENV infection or vaccination for further study (Table 1).MAbs were obtained from subjects with diverse infection histo-ries, including natural primary DENV1, -2, or -3 or secondaryinfections.\\nWe began to classify our panel of DII-FL MAbs for their bind-\\ning properties. Using real-time biosensor technology (Octet Redplatform), we ﬁrst performed competitive binding studies, usingrepresentative full-length MAbs, on either intact DENV particlesor recombinant E80 protein. As can be seen in Fig. 1, all represen-tative MAbs from our panel segregated into one competitiongroup, highlighted in red. No competition was observed betweenFL MAbs in our panel and antibodies known to bind prM proteinor E protein DIII. MAb 1C19 had a unique binding property com-pared to other MAbs in our panel, as it competed with the virion-only binding MAb 1F4, which recognizes the DI/II hinge region.\\nBreadth of neutralizing activity of human MAbs.

Many of the MAbs showed\\nFIG 1 Competition binding assays using DENV1 virion particles or DENV2 soluble envelope protein reveal four major competition groups, with an\\noverlapping speciﬁcity for the broad and potent monoclonal antibody 1C19.

Approximately half of the MAbs in our panel dis-\\nplayed moderate neutralization potency (EC50between 1 and\\n10/H9262g/ml) to viruses from at least one DENV serotype. Six anti-\\nbodies (1M4, 1M7, 1N5, 1C19, 1C18, and 4E8) potently neutral-ized viruses from at least one DENV serotype, with an EC\\n50of\\n/H110211.0/H9262g/ml. Two MAbs, 1M7 and 1C19, neutralized at least one\\nserotype below a 0.1- /H9262g/ml concentration. Finally, 1C19 showed\\nthe greatest cross-neutralizing potency, neutralizing DENV1, -2,and -3 at or below a concentration of 0.06\\n/H9262g/ml.\\nWe also assessed the neutralization activity of a subset of our\\npanel using Vero cells.

Although the disease caused by DENV is self-limiting in the \\ufb01rst\\ninfection, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) e \\u000bect increases the mortality in the second\\ninfection with a heterotypic virus. Since there is no speci\\ufb01c e \\u000ecient medicine in treatment, it is urgent\\nto develop vaccines to prevent infection and disease progression. Currently, only a live attenuated\\nvaccine, chimeric yellow fever 17D\\u2014tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), has been licensed for\\nclinical use in some countries, and many candidate vaccines are still under research and development.\\nThis review discusses the progress, strengths, and weaknesses of the \\ufb01ve types of vaccines including\\nlive attenuated vaccine, inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral vectored vaccine,\\nand DNA vaccine.\\nKeywords: dengue virus; dengue fever; vaccine; vector-borne disease\\n1. Introduction\\nDengue virus (DENV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA ( +ssRNA) virus belonging to\\ngenus Flavivirus of family Flaviviridae [ 1]. The mature particles of DENV are spherical and 50 nm in\\ndiameter [ 2]. The virus contains multiple copies of three structural proteins, including Envelope (E)\\nprotein, Membrane (M) protein, and Capsid (C) protein; a host-derived lipid bilayer envelope; and a\\nsingle copy of RNA genome [ 2]. DENV has four serotypes (DENV 1\\u20134) that are transmitted in humans\\nbyAedes mosquitoes [ 1]. The most common clinical manifestations are sudden fever with headache,\\nrecurrent eyelid pain, generalized muscle pain and joint pain, blushing, anorexia, and abdominal\\npain. All four serotypes can cause dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue\\nshock syndrome (DSS) [ 3]. DHF and DSS are the more severe e \\u000bects and more commonly seen in\\nthe infection of children and adolescents under \\ufb01fteen years old [ 4]. DENV infection produces a\\nhigh titer of neutralizing antibodies, which are considered an important component of the protective\\nimmune response [ 5,6]. Homotypic protection (protection against the same serotype infection) is\\nconsidered long-term e \\u000bective after a serotype infection, while heterotypic protection (cross protection\\nagainst the other serotypes infection) can last for approximately two years [ 7,8]. With the reduction of\\ncross-antibody titer, the second heterotypic dengue infection will be more serious than the \\ufb01rst [ 9].\\nFurthermore, non-neutralizing antibodies can form complexes with DENV particles and can facilitate\\nvirus infection to phagocytic cells via Fc receptors, resulting in enhanced infection and leading to DHF\\nand DSS. This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [ 3]. It is estimated that\\nVaccines 2020 ,8, 63; doi:10.3390 /vaccines8010063 www.mdpi.com /journal /vaccinesVaccines 2020 ,8, 63 2 of 13\\n390 million dengue infections happen every year, of which 96 million manifest clinically at any level of\\ndisease severity [ 10]. There is currently no speci\\ufb01c medicine for dengue treatments, and prevention\\nmajorly relies on vector control. Therefore, dengue vaccine development is urgently required for\\ndengue prevention.\\nFive types of dengue vaccines have been under investigation, including live attenuated vaccine,\\ninactivated vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral vectored vaccine, and DNA vaccine [ 11].\\nThey act primarily by increasing the immune responses against dengue virus (DENV) E protein and\\nnon-structural protein 1 (NS1) [ 12]. Careful studies of the immune responses to DENV help to form an\\ne\\u000bective strategy for dengue vaccine development [13].\\nTwo major challenges in dengue vaccine development have been discussed. Firstly, although\\nDENV antibodies show protective e \\u000bects against homotypic or heterotypic DENV infection, the ADE\\ne\\u000bect resulting from a second heterotypic infection majorly accounts for DHF and DSS [ 14\\u201316].\\nHowever, the immune response and pathogenesis of DHF and DSS are not fully understood, which\\nhinders DENV vaccine development [ 17]. Secondly, in vaccine development, we lack a conveniently\\naccessible, cheap, and sensitive animal model capable of simulating the immune responses in humans\\nafter infection. Since mice are naturally resistant to DENV infection, human cell chimeric mice and\\nimmunode\\ufb01cient mice sensitive to DENV infection are established to be used as animal models [ 18].\\nNonhuman primates (NHPs) are highly potential animal models because they produce a similar\\nimmune response to DENV infection as humans, but they are usually used following mouse tests\\nbecause of the costliness [19].\\n2. Live Attenuated Vaccine\\nLive attenuated vaccines are antigenic substances composed of a living pathogen, but the pathogen\\nis altered to be less virulent or avirulent [ 20]. Live attenuated vaccines show the advantages of delivering\\na set of protective antigens and of providing long-term immune protectivity [ 20]. Several live dengue\\nattenuated vaccines have been made with recombinant DNA technology, such as the chimeric yellow\\nfever 17D virus-tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), the recombinant DENV-4 mutant bearing\\na 30-nucleotide deletion vaccine (rDEN4 D30), and the tetra-live attenuated virus dengue vaccine\\n(DENVax) [21].\\n2.1. Live Attenuated Chimeric Yellow Fever\\u2013Dengue Vaccines\\nThe clinically developed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia\\u00ae) (Sano\\ufb01, Paris, France),\\ncomplying with the International Guidelines for New Vaccines [ 22] has been licensed by several\\ndengue-endemic countries in Asia and Latin America for use in people over 9 years old [ 23]. This vaccine\\nwas constructed by replacing the prM /E RNAs of the YF17D (yellow fever virus vaccine strain) with the\\ncorresponding sequences of the four dengue serotypes [ 24]. It has been observed in clinical trials that\\nvaccination with CYD-TDV is more e \\u000bective among people over 9 years old [ 25]. The vaccine-stimulated\\nimmunity lasts up to 4 years, and the virus serotype, age, and dengue sera status of the individual before\\nvaccination seem to a \\u000bect the vaccine e \\u000bectiveness [ 23]. However, long-term safety assessments showed\\nthat the risk of hospitalization for vaccinees was greater than that of placebo controls 3 years after\\nvaccination [ 26]. The reason for the reduced protectivity of CYD-TDV in seronegative subjects and the\\nincreased risk of hospitalization for children under 9 years old is unclear [ 27]. The CYD-TDV IIb clinical\\ntrial in Thailand and phase III clinical trials in Asia and Latin America found that it was ine \\u000bective\\nagainst DENV2 and that the \\ufb01rst-time immunization was less e \\u000bective than re-immunization [ 25,28,29].\\nThe better e \\u000ecacy of re-immunization may be due to the enhanced protectivity in the subjects by\\nstimulating preexisting immune memory [ 30]. In April 2018, the WHO Strategic Advisory Panel\\nrecommended that, in CYD-TDV vaccination, the priority assessment of DENV serostatus should be\\nconsidered to ensure that only dengue-seropositive individuals are vaccinated because CYD-TDV\\nvaccination in seronegative subjects increases the risk of severe dengue [ 31]. Therefore, rapid diagnostic\\ntests are needed before the vaccination. Since DENV belongs to the genus Flavivirus which also includesVaccines 2020 ,8, 63 3 of 13\\nZika virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus with highly homologous genomes,\\nproteins, and antibodies, antibody detection for these virus infections has high cross-reactivity and poor\\nreliability [ 32]. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the gold standard for establishing\\nserum status but requires speci\\ufb01c laboratory and technical capabilities. Furthermore, the detection\\nprocess of dengue IgG ELISA is complicated, and the diagnosis of IgG-containing point-of-care tests\\nlack sensitivity and speci\\ufb01city. Therefore, platform evaluation and well-characterized vaccine samples\\nare required to accelerate the clinical trials and market entry for CYD-TDV [33].\\n2.2. Live Attenuated rDEN D30 Vaccines\\nThere have been some studies to integrate DENV monovalent vaccines with the live attenuated\\ntetravalent vaccine (LATV) [ 34]. However, it is a challenge to develop a LATV that not only has\\nimmunogenicity for all four dengue serotypes but also has su \\u000ecient attenuation of each monovalent\\ncomponent [ 35\\u201337]. The 30- UTR region of the \\ufb02avivirus genome was chosen as a target for mutagenesis\\nbecause it plays an important role in viral RNA replication [ 38]. The LATV rDEN4 D30 vaccination\\nstimulated a seven-fold or greater increase in serum neutralizing antibody titer (mean titer =1:580)\\non day 28 post-vaccination, and was found to be very tolerant to all of the vaccinees, in which\\nonly a mild, asymptomatic macular rash developed, and a transient elevation in the serum level\\nof alanine aminotransferase was noted in several volunteers [ 39]. Prior to this, the experiments\\ntesting the ability of the vaccine virus spreading from vaccinees to mosquito vectors showed that\\nno vaccine virus was found in all 352 experimental mosquitoes [ 40]. Moreover, in order to increase\\nthe decay rate of rDEN4 D30 and to reduce the side e \\u000bects, many studies have optimized the paired\\ncharge\\u2013mutation of alanine and obtained rDEN-4 D30NS5-K200A and rDEN-4 D30NS5-H201A, which\\nshow good compatibility in human vaccination [ 41\\u201343]. Researchers also constructed rDEN4 D30\\nthrough chemical mutagenesis and successfully obtained rDEN-4 D30 NS3-S158R [41,44].\\nTV003 is a mixture of four attenuated recombinant dengue vaccine candidates including rDEN1D30,\\nrDEN2 /4D30, rDEN3D30 /31, and rDEN4D30, which is in the clinical trial phase and has more resistance\\nagainst DENV2 than CYD-TDV does [ 45,46]. It was found that, after vaccinated with TV003, antibodies\\nof the four DENV serotypes were detected in 91.7% of subjects and that the protective potency against\\nDENV2 was superior to that of CYD-TDV vaccination, with the only adverse reaction presenting\\na mild rash [ 47]. More DENV2 attenuated virus components were added to TV005 than to TV003.\\nA phase I clinical trial showed that a single vaccination of TV005 caused a relatively balanced immune\\nresponse in 90% of vaccinnees while TV003 vaccination only caused immune response in 76% of\\nrecipients [ 46]. TV003 and TV005 induce the most balanced neutralizing antibodies among the \\ufb01ve\\nLATVs (TV001\\u2013TV005) [27].\\nTV003 /TV005 is very di \\u000berent from CYD-TDV in characteristics due to their di \\u000berent virus particle\\nstructure, infectivity, and immunogenicity. For example, CYD results in a higher risk of viremia, lower\\nresistance against DENV2 virus, and lower level of induced immune balance than TV003 /TV005 [27].\\n2.3. Live Attenuated Chimeric Tetra-Dengue Vaccines\\nScientists used the attenuated virus DENV2 PDK-53 as a genetic backbone to replace its coding\\nsequences with that of DENV1, DENV3, and DENV4; the recombinant RNAs were used to transfect\\nVero cells to produce a vaccine candidate called DENVax [ 48]. These tetra-live attenuated virus (TLAV)\\nvaccines are undergoing clinical trials [ 44]. To investigate whether the vaccination of DENVax in\\nmothers would a \\u000bect the re-inoculation e \\u000bects in o \\u000bspring, AG129 mice were used as the model,\\nand it was found that the vaccination e \\u000bects of the pups born by PDK53 immunized mothers may be\\ninterfered with by their maternal antibodies [23].\\nIn summary, the live attenuated vaccine CYD-TDV has a de\\ufb01nitive protectivity in DENV\\nseropositive subjects over 9 years old. The rDEN D30 vaccine makes up for the low immune balance of\\nCYD-TDV . DENVax is highly immunogenic tolerant and is hard to induce systemic reactions.Vaccines 2020 ,8, 63 4 of 13\\n3. Inactivated Virus Vaccines\\nInactivated vaccines are antigenic substances composed of inactivated material from a pathogen\\n(such as virus or bacterium) which can elicit protectivity against the live pathogen [ 49]. A DENV2\\ninactivated vaccine named S16803 was developed by formalin inactivation and sucrose centrifugal\\npuri\\ufb01cation and demonstrated its e \\u000bectiveness in rhesus monkeys [ 49,50]. The immunogenicity of\\nthe recombinant subunit protein vaccine (R80E) and live attenuated vaccine (DENV2 PDK-50) was\\ncompared with the inactivated vaccine S16803 in rhesus monkeys, and it was found that only DENV2\\nPDK-50 can produce stable titers of antibodies [ 51]. Tetravalent puri\\ufb01ed formalin-inactivated virus\\n(TPIV) is an inactivated vaccine containing four inactivated dengue serotypes [ 52]. Rhesus monkey\\nvaccination initiated with TPIV or tetravalent DNA vaccine (TDNA) and then enhanced with TLAV\\nshowed promoted humoral immunity against dengue virus compared with the vaccination using only\\none type of vaccine [ 53]. It is reported that the antibody titers of four serotypes of DENV reached a\\ncertain height by using TPIV to initiate immunization and then TLAV to enhance immunization [52].\\nInactivated dengue virus vaccine uses C, M, E, and NS1 protein components as antigens to\\nstimulate immunity, but composite vaccines arouse better protectivity than single-type vaccines.\\nCompared with live attenuated vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines are safer with no hidden danger of\\nreactivation and better controlled immune balance.\\n4. Recombinant Subunit Vaccines\\nRecombinant subunit vaccines are antigenic proteins expressed by prokaryotic or eukaryotic\\ncells to stimulate long-lasting protective /therapeutic immune responses [ 54\\u201356]. Expression of the\\nrecombinant dengue proteins in E. coli is relatively easy, but meanwhile, there are some problems\\nof endotoxin contamination and improper protein folding [ 57]. The recombinant envelope protein\\ndomain III (EDIII) expressed by E. coli and puri\\ufb01ed by metal a \\u000enity membrane chromatography\\nwas shown to successfully induce antibodies against the four serotypes of dengue in mice [ 58], and\\nthese antibodies also protected lactating mice from infection [ 59]. Another tetravalent recombinant\\nsubunit vaccine combined with alum adjuvant in vaccination produces high titers of antibodies in mice,\\nbut it induced only DENV2 antibodies in adult macaques [ 60,61]. Recombinant dengue proteins fused\\nwith a lipoprotein were expressed in a lipid form, thereby eliminating the use of adjuvants, and the\\nviral antigens successfully provoked immune responses against the four serotypes in mice [ 60,62,63].\\nIn addition, EDIII-P64K was an adjuvant-containing tetravalent dengue vaccine expressing P64K of\\nNeisseria meningitidis and EDIII of di \\u000berent DENV serotypes [ 64]. The mice were immunized with\\nEDIII-P64K three times, and high titers of antibodies against DENV1\\u20133 and low titers of antibodies\\nagainst DENV4 were produced [ 65]. Furthermore, a combination of DENV1\\u20132 EDIII and DENV3\\u20134\\nEDIII linked with a Gly-Ser linker was expressed in E. coli , and this vaccine successfully induced\\nimmune protection against the four serotypes of DENV in mice. [ 66]. LTB-scEDIII was a fusion protein\\nexpressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, containing the E. coli heat-labile toxin protein B-subunit (LTB)\\nand the synthetic consensus dengue envelope domain III (scEDIII) from the four serotypes. Oral\\nimmunization with the intact recombinant yeast cells (rYC) and the cell-free extracts (CFE) was found\\nto stimulate systemic humoral and mucosal immune responses in mice. The titers of neutralizing\\nantibodies in CFE-fed mice were higher than that in rYC-fed mice [67].\\nThe most promising subunit vaccine is V180, which consists of a truncated protein DEN-80E\\nexpressed in insect cells. V180 vaccination in a low dose successfully induced a high level of immune\\nprotection against DENV in mice and rhesus monkeys [ 68]. It has been reported that V180-immunized\\nrhesus monkeys can be protected from viremia [ 69]. Sf-9 cells expressing DENV E protein elicited\\nnot only speci\\ufb01c Th2 responses and weak Th1 responses but also neutralizing antibodies against\\nDENV1-4 [ 70,71]. Furthermore, recombinant DENV2 NS1 protein expressed with S-2 cells successfully\\nelicited immune protection in mice [ 12]. A fusion protein containing the DENV consensus domain III\\n(cEDIII) and polymeric immunoglobulin G sca \\u000bold (PIGS) was expressed in Chinese ovary hamster\\ncells and transgenic plants, which induced high titer of IgG antibody in mice and showed neutralizingVaccines 2020 ,8, 63 5 of 13\\npotential against DENV2 [ 72]. The production of DENV EDIII in transgenic non-nicotine tobacco\\nillustrates the feasibility of plant transgenic vaccine [ 73], but it had not been tested in any animal\\nmodels. A single polypeptide chain comprising EDIII of all four serotypes tetra-EDIII (tEDIII) and\\ncoenzyme 1 (Co1) was expressed in rice, and the transgenic rice containing 100 \\u0016g of tEDIIII-Co1 was\\nfed to mice, presenting strong antigen-speci\\ufb01c B and T cell responses [74].\\nCompared with live attenuated vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines are more likely to trigger\\nbalanced immune responses against the four serotypes, reducing the incidence of ADE e \\u000bect [55,56].\\n5. Viral Vectored Vaccines\\nVaccinia virus, adenovirus, and alphavirus vectors have been used as delivery vectors for DENV\\nantigens in vaccine development [ 11]. It is recorded that prM, E, NS1, and NS2A proteins of DENV4\\nexpressed low e \\u000eciency in Cidofovir-resistant vaccinia (WR) strain [ 75]. Full-length or c-terminal\\ntruncated vaccinia virus were recombinated to express DENV E protein to enhance their protectivity [ 76].\\nHowever, the non-attenuated WR strain may bring safety hazards. Immunization of mice with these\\nrecombinant vaccines induced only a low level of speci\\ufb01c antibodies against E protein [ 77,78]. Based\\non the safer modi\\ufb01ed vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, MVA-DENV2\\u201380%E and MVA-DENV4\\u201380%E\\nwere then constructed, which can induce high anti-E antibodies in mice, but the former produced low\\nlevels of antibodies against DENV2 in rhesus monkeys [79].\\nAdenoviral vectors show many advantages such as easy gene manipulation, easy detection of\\ngene replication defects, and high level of protein expression [ 80]. A recombinant replication-defective\\nadenovirus (rAd) expressing the E protein of DENV2 was constructed to vaccinate the mice\\nintraperitoneally, which successfully stimulated DENV2 antibodies and speci\\ufb01c T cell immunity\\nin these mice [ 81,82]. Furthermore, when \\ufb01rst immunized with rAd and then boosted with a DNA\\nvaccine expressing EDIII, the mice presented protectivity against DENV2 and DENV4 [ 83]. The\\ncAdVaxD (1\\u20132) and cAdVaxD (3\\u20134), two divalent complex Adenovirus (cAd) -vectored vaccines\\nexpressing prM and E of the DENVs, could induce antibodies against four serotypes and T cell immune\\nprotection in rhesus monkeys [84,85].\\nIn addition, the alphavirus-vectored dengue vaccines have high potential. High levels of antigen\\nexpression were detected in a single round of vaccination with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus\\nreplicon particles (VRP), and antigen presentation was guaranteed due to the adjuvant activity of VRP\\nand the e \\u000bect of VRP on dendritic cells (DC) in lymph nodes [ 86,87]. VRP expressing the M and E\\nproteins of DENV1 induced protective antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys [ 88]. Immunization with\\nDENV2 VRP in mice produced speci\\ufb01c IgG and neutralizing antibodies against DENV2. VRP was\\nconstructed to express prM-E and E85; both E85-VRP and prM-E-VRP produced a serotype-speci\\ufb01c\\nantibody against EDIII in rhesus monkeys immunization, but E85-VRP developed antibodies faster and\\nwith higher titers [ 89]. The tetravalent E85-VRP dengue vaccine induced a balanced immune response\\nand protectivity against DENV1\\u20134 in monkeys with 2 doses given 6 weeks apart [ 89]. A tetravalent\\nVRP vaccine induced antibodies at an equivalent level as a monovalent vaccine did after a single\\nimmunization, indicating that it could overcome serotype interference [ 90]. Although the magnitude\\nof the neonatal immune response was lower than that of adult mice, experiments have shown that the\\nVRP vaccine produced a strong protective immunity after a single neonatal immunization [90].\\nViral vectored vaccine is still the best way to induce cellular immunity, and it is hopeful to\\ninduce stronger humoral responses. Compared with the other viral vectored vaccines, adenoviral\\nvectors are superior in easy genetic manipulation, detection of gene replication defects, and high\\nantigen expression.\\n6. DNA Vaccines\\nA DNA vaccine is a plasmid containing one or more genes encoding speci\\ufb01c antigens, which\\ncan be injected in vivo to express antigens and to stimulate immune responses [ 91]. A DNA vaccine\\nexpressing prM and 92% of E protein of DENV2 was used to vaccinate BALB /c mice intradermally,Vaccines 2020 ,8, 63 6 of 13\\nand anti-dengue antibodies were detected in all these mice [ 91]. When the DNA vaccine expressing\\nE80 (80% of E protein) was compared with the one expressing ME100 (prM and 100% of E protein),\\nthe ME100 was found to stimulate antibody production more e \\u000eciently in mice [ 92].Aotus nancymae\\nmonkeys were immunized with D1ME100 intradermally and intramuscularly and then boosted at 1\\nand 5 months post priming; Aotus monkeys were partially or completely protected against DENV1\\nchallenge at 6 months post priming [ 93]. In a human test, D1ME100 showed safe and well-tolerant\\ne\\u000bects in the \\ufb01rst phase of vaccination and the most common side e \\u000bect was mild pain or tenderness at\\nthe injection site. However, the immunogenicity of the vaccine was poor; only 41.6% of the subjects\\nreceiving high-dose vaccination produced neutralizing antibodies, and no neutralizing antibody\\nresponse was detected in the low-dose group [94].\\nA DNA vaccine expressing DENV2 prM /E fused with the immunostimulatory CpG motif was\\nreported to produce protective immunity against DENV2 and to improve the neutralizing antibody\\nresponse e \\u000eciently compared with the DENV2 prM /E DNA vaccine [ 95]. Moreover, the DENV2 DNA\\nvaccine expressing a recombinant protein containing DENV2 EDIII and Escherichia maltose-binding\\nprotein (MBP) was used to immunize mice and was found to be able to elicit neutralizing antibodies\\nin mice [ 96]. Scientists have evaluated the e \\u000ecacy of three nonreplicating DENV2 vaccines in\\nrhesus monkeys alone or in combination: DENV2 prM /E DNA vaccine (D), DENV2 EDIII and MBP\\nrecombinant fusion protein (R), and puri\\ufb01ed inactivated virus particles (P). The results showed that\\nDNA vaccine used alone induced a moderate level of neutralizing antibodies while DNA vaccine\\ncombined with recombinant proteins induced higher titers of antibodies and neutralization levels. The\\nantibody titers of DR /DR/DR, DP /DP/DP , and R /R/R vaccination were the highest, while the titer of\\nD/D/D vaccination was the lowest. Interestingly, signi\\ufb01cant immune protection against viremia was\\nobserved only in the animals vaccinated with P [97].\\nSome guiding proteins targeting the immune system were used to enhance the protectivity in\\nDNA vaccine development. For example, integrating antigen sequence into lysosomal membrane\\nprotein increases the expression of MHC class II antigens, thereby enhancing the production of CD4\\nT cells and anti-CD4 antigens and ultimately improving the immunogenicity of the DENV2 prM /E\\nDNA vaccine [ 98]. A DNA vaccine expressing an antigen fused with a single-chain Fv antibody (scFv)\\nspeci\\ufb01c for the DC endocytic receptor DEC205 could induce a strong immune response to the target\\nantigen [99].\\nThe combination of tetravalent DNA vaccine (TVDV), tetravalent puri\\ufb01ed formalin-inactivated\\nvirus (TPIV), and tetra-live attenuated virus (TLAV)-enhanced vaccination strategy was tested in\\nrhesus monkeys, and monkeys immunized with TVDV /TVDV /TLAV were partially protected while\\nTPIV /TLAV immunized monkeys were completely free of viremia [ 64]. In phase 1 clinical trials,\\na TVDV with Vaxfectin\\u00ae(Vical, Boulder, CO, USA) adjuvant was found to trigger anti-dengue T cell\\nIFN\\rresponse with ideal safety [100].\\nDNA vaccines are stable, easy to prepare, low in cost, and suitable for mass production but lack\\nhigh immunogenicity. Therefore, plasmid modi\\ufb01cation with highly e \\u000ecient promoters, alternative\\ndelivery strategies, multiple doses, and co-immunization with adjuvants may be the ways to solve this\\nproblem [101].\\n7. Conclusions and Future Perspectives\\nIn general, there are \\ufb01ve types of vaccines against DENV including live attenuated vaccine,\\ninactivated vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral vectored vaccine, and DNA vaccine. Among\\nthe dengue vaccine candidates in use or in clinical trials (Table 1), live attenuated tetravalent dengue\\nvaccine (CYD-TDV) can stimulate neutralizing antibodies in humans, but the lack of ability to neutralize\\nDENV2 virus limits its use. Immunization of female mice with the live attenuated vaccine DENVax\\nmay interfere with the vaccination e \\u000bect of the born pups. Compared with the live attenuated vaccines,\\nrecombinant subunit vaccines are more likely to trigger a balanced immune response against the four\\nserotypes but bring problems of endotoxin contamination and improper protein folding. AdenoviralVaccines 2020 ,8, 63 7 of 13\\nvectored vaccines show many advantages, such as ease of genetic manipulation, easy detection of\\ngene replication defects, and high levels of protein expression. Alphavirus-vectored dengue vaccines\\nproduce a strong protective immunity after a single neonatal immunization in mice. DNA vaccines are\\nstable, low in cost, and easy for mass production; however, the problem of low immunogenicity remains\\nto be solved. In terms of vaccination strategy, the immunization priming and boosting with di \\u000berent\\nvaccine combinations has been used to develop successful protectivity in animals. Furthermore,\\nnew vaccine development concepts have been proved to be viable, such as DENV NS1-based and\\nmosquito-based immunization strategies [ 12]. In addition, studying the immune mechanism of viral\\ncomponents in disease transmission is helpful to break through the bottleneck of vaccine development.\\nTable 1.
